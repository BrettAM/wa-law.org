== 43.70.005 - Intent.
The legislature finds and declares that it is of importance to the people of Washington state to live in a healthy environment and to expect a minimum standard of quality in health care. The legislature further finds that the social and economic vitality of the state depends on a healthy and productive population. The legislature further declares where it is a duty of the state to assure a healthy environment and minimum standards of quality in health care facilities and among health care professionals, the ultimate responsibility for a healthy society lies with the citizens themselves.

For these reasons, the legislature recognizes the need for a strong, clear focus on health issues in state government and among state health agencies to give expression to the needs of individual citizens and local communities as they seek to preserve the public health. It is the intent of the legislature to form such focus by creating a single department in state government with the primary responsibilities for the preservation of public health, monitoring health care costs, the maintenance of minimal standards for quality in health care delivery, and the general oversight and planning for all the state's activities as they relate to the health of its citizenry.

Further, it is the intent of the legislature to improve illness and injury prevention and health promotion, and restore the confidence of the citizenry in the efficient and accountable expenditure of public funds on health activities that further the mission of the agency via grants and contracts, and to ensure that this new health agency delivers quality health services in an efficient, effective, and economical manner that is faithful and responsive to policies established by the legislature.

== 43.70.057 - Hospital emergency room patient care information—Data collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination—Rules.
. The legislature finds that public health data is critical to the department's ability to respond to emerging public health threats and chronic conditions affecting the public health and, therefore, intends that the department be fully informed about emerging public health threats and chronic conditions that may impact the health of Washington citizens.

. The department shall require hospitals with emergency departments to submit emergency department patient care information, which must be collected, maintained, analyzed, and disseminated by the department. The department shall also accept other data types submitted voluntarily as approved by the department. The data must be collected in a way that allows automated reporting by electronic transmission. Emergency departments submitting data must be able to obtain their data and aggregate regional and statewide data from the collection system within thirty minutes of submission of a query for the data once the data is available in the system. The department may, if deemed cost-effective and efficient, contract with a private entity for any or all parts of data collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination. The department or contractor shall include the following elements:

.. A demonstrated ability to collect the data required by this section in a way that allows automated reporting by electronic transmission;

.. An established data submission arrangement with the majority of emergency departments required to submit data pursuant to this section;

.. The demonstrated ability to allow emergency departments submitting data to immediately obtain their own data and aggregate regional and statewide data and the department to immediately obtain any data within thirty minutes of submission of a query for data once the data is available in the system; and

.. The capacity to work with existing emergency department data systems to minimize administrative reporting burden and costs.

. Data elements must be reported in conformance with a uniform reporting system established by the department in collaboration with representatives from emergency departments required to submit data pursuant to this section and in conformance with current or emerging national standards for reporting similar data. Data elements to be initially collected include, but are not limited to, data elements identifying facility information, limited patient identifiers, patient demographics, and encounter, clinical, and laboratory information. In order to ensure meaningful public health surveillance, after consulting with emergency departments required to submit data pursuant to this section, the department shall adopt rules including, but not limited to, data element and format requirements and time frames for reporting and addressing errors in submission. The rules adopted shall support alignment with current or emerging national standards for reporting similar data and minimization of administrative burden and costs.

. The department may require additional information from data providers only for the purposes of validating data received, verifying data accuracy, conducting surveillance of potential public health threats, and addressing potential public health threats.

. The data collected, maintained, and analyzed by the department must only be available for retrieval in original or processed form to public and private requestors pursuant to subsection (6) of this section and must be available within a reasonable period of time after the date of request, except that emergency departments submitting data pursuant to this section must have the ability to immediately obtain their own data and aggregate regional and statewide data within thirty minutes of submission of a query for data once the data is available in the system. The cost of retrieving their own data and aggregate regional and statewide data in standardized reports for state, local, tribal, federal officials and agencies, and health care facilities, and health care providers associated with the emergency departments submitting data pursuant to this section, must be funded through the agency's resources. The cost of retrieving data for individuals and organizations engaged in research or private use of data or reports must be funded by a fee schedule developed by the department that reflects the direct cost of retrieving the data or report in the requested form.

. The department must maintain the confidentiality of patient data it collects under subsection (2) of this section. Patient data collected by the department is health care information under chapter 70.02 RCW. Patient data that includes direct and indirect identifiers is not subject to public inspection and copying and the department may only release that data as allowed for in this section. Any agency that receives patient data under (a) or (b) of this subsection must also maintain the confidentiality of the data and may not release the data except as consistent with subsection (7)(b) of this section. The department may release the data as follows:

.. Data that includes direct and indirect patient identifiers, as specifically defined in rule, may be released to:

...(A) Federal, Washington state, tribal, and local government agencies upon receipt of a signed data use agreement with the department;

(B) In the case of an emergent public health threat, the signed data use agreement requirement must be waived for public health authorities. The department may disclose only the minimum amount of information necessary, to the fewest number of people, for the least amount of time required to address the threat;

... Researchers with approval of an institutional review board upon receipt of a signed confidentiality agreement with the department;

.. Data that does not contain direct patient identifiers but may contain indirect patient identifiers may be released to agencies, institutional review board-approved researchers, and other persons upon receipt of a signed data use agreement with the department;

.. Data that does not contain direct or indirect patient identifiers may be released on request.

. Recipients of data under subsection (6)(a) and (b) of this section must agree in a data use agreement, as applicable, at a minimum, to:

.. Take steps to protect direct and indirect patient identifiers as described in the data use agreement; and

.. Not redisclose the data except as authorized in their data use agreement consistent with the purpose of the agreement.

. Recipients of data under subsection (6)(b) and (c) of this section must not attempt to determine the identity of persons whose information is included in the data set or use the data in any manner that identifies individuals or their families.

. For the purposes of this section:

.. "Direct patient identifier" means information that identifies a patient; and

.. "Indirect patient identifier" means information that may identify a patient when combined with other information.

. The department may adopt rules necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this section. The department must consider national standards when adopting rules.

== 43.70.060 - Duties of department—Promotion of health care cost-effectiveness.
It is the intent of the legislature to promote appropriate use of health care resources to maximize access to adequate health care services. The legislature understands that the rapidly increasing costs of health care are limiting access to care. To promote health care cost-effectiveness, the department shall:

. Implement the certificate of need program;

. Monitor and evaluate health care costs;

. Evaluate health services and the utilization of services for outcome and effectiveness; and

. Recommend strategies to encourage adequate and cost-effective services and discourage ineffective services.

== 43.70.064 - Health care quality—Findings and intent—Requirements for conducting study under RCW  43.70.066.
The legislature finds that it is difficult for consumers of health care services to determine the quality of health care prior to purchase or utilization of medical care. The legislature also finds that accountability is a key component in promoting quality assurance and quality improvement throughout the health care delivery system, including public programs. Quality assurance and improvement standards are necessary to promote the public interest, contribute to cost efficiencies, and improve the ability of consumers to ascertain quality health care purchases.

The legislature intends to have consumers, health carriers, health care providers and facilities, and public agencies participate in the development of quality assurance and improvement standards that can be used to develop a uniform quality assurance program for use by all public and private health plans, providers, and facilities. To that end, in conducting the study required under RCW 43.70.066, the department of health shall:

. Consider the needs of consumers, employers, health care providers and facilities, and public and private health plans;

. Take full advantage of existing national standards of quality assurance to extend to middle-income populations the protections required for state management of health programs for low-income populations;

. Consider the appropriate minimum level of quality assurance standards that should be disclosed to consumers and employers by health care providers and facilities, and public and private health plans; and

. Consider standards that permit health care providers and facilities to share responsibility for participation in a uniform quality assurance program.

== 43.70.066 - Study—Uniform quality assurance and improvement program—Reports to legislature—Limitation on rule making.
. The department of health shall study the feasibility of a uniform quality assurance and improvement program for use by all public and private health plans and health care providers and facilities. In this study, the department shall consult with:

.. Public and private purchasers of health care services;

.. Health carriers;

.. Health care providers and facilities; and

.. Consumers of health services.

. In conducting the study, the department shall propose standards that meet the needs of affected persons and organizations, whether public or private, without creation of differing levels of quality assurance. All consumers of health services should be afforded the same level of quality assurance.

. At a minimum, the study shall include but not be limited to the following program components and indicators appropriate for consumer disclosure:

.. Health care provider training, credentialing, and licensure standards;

.. Health care facility credentialing and recredentialing;

.. Staff ratios in health care facilities;

.. Annual mortality and morbidity rates of cases based on a defined set of procedures performed or diagnoses treated in health care facilities, adjusted to fairly consider variable factors such as patient demographics and case severity;

.. The average total cost and average length of hospital stay for a defined set of procedures and diagnoses;

.. The total number of the defined set of procedures, by specialty, performed by each physician at a health care facility within the previous twelve months;

.. Utilization performance profiles by provider, both primary care and specialty care, that have been adjusted to fairly consider variable factors such as patient demographics and severity of case;

.. Health plan fiscal performance standards;

.. Health care provider and facility recordkeeping and reporting standards;

.. Health care utilization management that monitors trends in health service underutilization, as well as overutilization of services;

.. Health monitoring that is responsive to consumer, purchaser, and public health assessment needs; and

.. Assessment of consumer satisfaction and disclosure of consumer survey results.

. In conducting the study, the department shall develop standards that permit each health care facility, provider group, or health carrier to assume responsibility for and determine the physical method of collection, storage, and assimilation of quality indicators for consumer disclosure. The study may define the forms, frequency, and posting requirements for disclosure of information.

In developing proposed standards under this subsection, the department shall identify options that would minimize provider burden and administrative cost resulting from duplicative private sector data submission requirements.

. The department shall submit a preliminary report to the legislature by December 31, 1995, including recommendations for initial legislation pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, and may submit supplementary reports and recommendations as completed, consistent with appropriated funds and staffing.

. The department shall not adopt any rule implementing the uniform quality assurance program or consumer disclosure provisions unless expressly directed to do so by an act of law.

. In any action brought by the secretary of health or by a local health officer pursuant to chapter 7.60 RCW to place a public water system in receivership, the petition shall include the names of one or more suitable candidates for receiver who have consented to assume operation of the water system. The department shall maintain a list of interested and qualified individuals, municipal entities, special purpose districts, and investor-owned water companies with experience in the provision of water service and a history of satisfactory operation of a water system. If there is no other person willing and able to be named as receiver, the court shall appoint the county in which the water system is located as receiver. The county may designate a county agency to operate the system, or it may contract with another individual or public water system to provide management for the system. If the county is appointed as receiver, the secretary of health and the county health officer shall provide regulatory oversight for the agency or other person responsible for managing the water system.

. In any petition for receivership under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall recommend that the court grant to the receiver full authority to act in the best interests of the customers served by the public water system. The receiver shall assess the capability, in conjunction with the department and local government, for the system to operate in compliance with health and safety standards, and shall report to the court and the petitioning agency its recommendations for the system's future operation, including the formation of a water-sewer district or other public entity, or ownership by another existing water system capable of providing service.

. If a petition for receivership and verifying affidavit executed by an appropriate departmental official allege an immediate and serious danger to residents constituting an emergency, the court shall set the matter for hearing within three days and may appoint a temporary receiver ex parte upon the strength of such petition and affidavit pending a full evidentiary hearing, which shall be held within fourteen days after receipt of the petition.

. A bond, if any is imposed upon a receiver, shall be minimal and shall reasonably relate to the level of operating revenue generated by the system. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this section shall not be held personally liable for any good faith, reasonable effort to assume possession of, and to operate, the system in compliance with the court's orders.

. The court shall authorize the receiver to impose reasonable assessments on a water system's customers to recover expenditures for improvements necessary for the public health and safety.

. No later than twelve months after appointment of a receiver, the petitioning agency, in conjunction with the county in which the system is located, and the appropriate state and local health agencies, shall develop and present to the court a plan for the disposition of the system. The report shall include the recommendations of the receiver made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The report shall include all reasonable and feasible alternatives. After receiving the report, the court shall provide notice to interested parties and conduct such hearings as are necessary. The court shall then order the parties to implement one of the alternatives, or any combination thereof, for the disposition of the system. Such order shall include a date, or proposed date, for the termination of the receivership. Nothing in this section authorizes a court to require a city, town, public utility district, water-sewer district, or irrigation district to accept a system that has been in receivership unless the city, town, public utility district, water-sewer district, or irrigation district agrees to the terms and conditions outlined in the plan adopted by the court.

. The court shall not terminate the receivership, and order the return of the system to the owners, unless the department of health approves of such an action. The court may impose reasonable conditions upon the return of the system to the owner, including the posting of a bond or other security, routine performance and financial audits, employment of qualified operators and other staff or contracted services, compliance with financial viability requirements, or other measures sufficient to ensure the ongoing proper operation of the system.

. If, as part of the ultimate disposition of the system, an eminent domain action is commenced by a public entity to acquire the system, the court shall oversee any appraisal of the system conducted under Title 7 RCW to assure that the appraised value properly reflects any reduced value because of the necessity to make improvements to the system. The court shall have the authority to approve the appraisal, and to modify it based on any information provided at an evidentiary hearing. The court's determination of the proper value of the system, based on the appraisal, shall be final, and only appealable if not supported by substantial evidence. If the appraised value is appealed, the court may order that the system's ownership be transferred upon payment of the approved appraised value.

Administrative procedures and administrative requirements do not include establishing, monitoring, and enforcing qualifications for licensure, scope or standards of practice, continuing competency mechanisms, and discipline when such authority is authorized in statute to a health profession board or commission. For the purposes of this section, "in consultation with" means providing an opportunity for meaningful participation in development of rules consistent with processes set forth in RCW 34.05.310.

. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary which provides for a licensing period for any type of license subject to this chapter including those under RCW 18.130.040, the secretary of health may, from time to time, extend or otherwise modify the duration of any licensing, certification, or registration period, whether an initial or renewal period, if the secretary determines that it would result in a more economical or efficient operation of state government and that the public health, safety, or welfare would not be substantially adversely affected thereby. However, no license, certification, or registration may be issued or approved for a period in excess of four years, without renewal. Such extension, reduction, or other modification of a licensing, certification, or registration period shall be by rule or regulation of the department of health adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW. Such rules and regulations may provide a method for imposing and collecting such additional proportional fee as may be required for the extended or modified period.

Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department, in collaboration with the department of social and health services, the state fire marshal's office, the superintendent of public instruction, and the Washington state council of firefighters, must review existing local training programs and training programs being used in other states and design a statewide training program that will familiarize fire department and emergency medical service personnel with the techniques, procedures, and protocols for best handling situations in which persons with disabilities are present at the scene of an emergency in order to maximize the safety of persons with disabilities, minimize the likelihood of injury to persons with disabilities, and promote the safety of all persons present. The program must include a checklist of disabilities, symptoms of such disabilities, and things to do and not to do relevant to a particular disability so fire department and emergency medical services personnel can easily and quickly determine the specific scenario into which they are entering. The department must make the training program available on the department's web site for use by all fire departments and emergency medical service agencies in the state. The department must include on its web site a list of public and private nonprofit disability-related agencies and organizations and the contact information of each agency and organization. Fire departments and emergency medical service agencies must ensure their employees are adequately trained in and familiarized with techniques, procedures, and protocols for best handling situations in which persons with particular disabilities are present at the scene of an emergency.

. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the criminal justice training commission, in consultation with the Washington state patrol and other stakeholders, must examine existing training programs and curricula related to law enforcement officers responding to an emergency where a person with a disability may be present, to ensure that those programs and curricula are consistent with best practices.

. For purposes of this section:

.. Both "accident" and "emergency" mean an unforeseen combination of circumstances or a resulting situation that results in a need for assistance or relief and calls for immediate action; and

.. "Persons with disabilities" means individuals who have been diagnosed medically to have a physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, behavioral, developmental, or sensory disability.

== 43.70.495 - Telemedicine training for health care professionals.
. The legislature finds that a large segment of Washington residents do not have access to critical health care services. Telemedicine is a way to increase access to health care services to those who would otherwise not have reasonable access. The legislature therefore intends to ensure that health care professionals who provide services through telemedicine, as defined in RCW 70.41.020, in cities and rural areas alike, have current information available, making it possible for them to provide telemedicine services to the entire state of Washington.

. Except as permitted under subsection (3) of this section, beginning January 1, 2021, a health care professional who provides clinical services through telemedicine, other than a physician licensed under chapter 18.71 RCW or an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 18.57 RCW, shall complete a telemedicine training. By January 1, 2020, the telemedicine collaborative shall make a telemedicine training available on its web site for use by health care professionals who use telemedicine technology. If a health care professional completes the training, the health care professional shall sign and retain an attestation. The training:

.. Must include information on current state and federal law, liability, informed consent, and other criteria established by the collaborative for the advancement of telemedicine, in collaboration with the department and the Washington state medical quality assurance commission;

.. Must include a question and answer methodology to demonstrate accrual of knowledge; and

.. May be made available in electronic format and completed over the internet.

. A health care professional is deemed to have met the requirements of subsection (2) of this section if the health care professional:

.. Completes an alternative telemedicine training; and

.. Signs and retains an attestation that he or she completed the alternative telemedicine training.

. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

.. "Alternative telemedicine training" means training that includes components that are substantively similar to the telemedicine training developed by the telemedicine collaborative under subsection (2) of this section. "Alternative telemedicine training" may include, but is not limited to:

... Training offered by hospitals and other health care facilities to employees of the facility;

... Continuing education courses; and

... Trainings developed by a health care professional board or commission.

.. "Health care professional" means a person licensed, registered, or certified to provide health services.

The legislature recognizes that the state patrol, the administrative office of the courts, the sheriffs' and police chiefs' association, the department of social and health services, the *department of community, trade, and economic development, the sentencing guidelines commission, the department of corrections, and the superintendent of public instruction each have comprehensive data and analysis capabilities that have contributed greatly to our current understanding of crime and violence, and their causes.

The legislature finds, however, that a single health-oriented agency must be designated to provide consistent guidelines to all these groups regarding the way in which their data systems collect this important data. It is not the intent of the legislature by RCW 43.70.545 to transfer data collection requirements from existing agencies or to require the addition of major new data systems. It is rather the intent to make only the minimum required changes in existing data systems to increase compatibility and comparability, reduce duplication, and to increase the usefulness of data collected by these agencies in developing more accurate descriptions of violence.

. The department of health shall develop, based on recommendations in the public health services improvement plan and in consultation with affected groups or agencies, comprehensive rules for the collection and reporting of data relating to acts of violence, at-risk behaviors, and risk and protective factors. The data collection and reporting rules shall be used by any public or private entity that is required to report data relating to these behaviors and conditions. The department may require any agency or program that is state-funded or that accepts state funds and any licensed or regulated person or professional to report these behaviors and conditions. To the extent possible the department shall require the reports to be filed through existing data systems. The department may also require reporting of attempted acts of violence and of nonphysical injuries. For the purposes of this section "acts of violence" means self-directed and interpersonal behaviors that can result in suicide, homicide, and nonfatal intentional injuries. "At-risk behaviors," "protective factors," and "risk factors" have the same meanings as provided in *RCW 70.190.010.

== 43.70.665 - Early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program—Medical advisory committee.
. The legislature finds that Washington state has the highest incidence of breast cancer in the nation. Despite this, mortality rates from breast cancer have declined due largely to early screening and detection. Invasive cervical cancer is the most preventable type of cancer. The Pap test, used to detect early signs of this disease, has been called "medicine's most successful screening test." Applied consistently, invasive cervical cancer could nearly be eliminated. The legislature further finds that increasing access to breast and cervical cancer screening is critical to reducing incidence and mortality rates, and eliminating the disparities of this disease in women in Washington state. Furthermore, the legislature finds there is a need for a permanent program providing early detection and screening to the women and families of Washington state.

It is the intent of the legislature to establish an early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program as a voluntary screening program directed at reducing mortalities through early detection to be offered to eligible women only as funds are available.

. As used in this section:

.. "Eligible woman" means a woman who is age forty to sixty-four, and whose income is at or below two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level, as published annually by the federal department of health and human services. Priority enrollment shall be given to women as defined by the federal national breast and cervical cancer early detection program, under P.L. 101-354.

.. "Approved providers" means those state-supported health providers, radiology facilities, and cytological laboratories that are recognized by the department as meeting the minimum program policies and procedures adopted by the department to qualify under the federal national breast and cervical cancer early detection program, and are designated as eligible for funding by the department.

.. "Comprehensive" means a screening program that focuses on breast and cervical cancer screening as a preventive health measure, and includes diagnostic and case management services.

. The department of health is authorized to administer a state-supported early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program to assist eligible women with preventive health services. To the extent of available funding, eligible women may be enrolled in the early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program and additional eligible women may be enrolled to the extent that grants and contributions from community sources provide sufficient funds for expanding the program.

. Funds appropriated for the state program shall be used only to operate early detection breast and cervical cancer screening programs that have been approved by the department, or to increase access to existing state-approved programs, and shall not supplant federally supported breast and cervical cancer early detection programs.

. Enrollment in the early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program shall not result in expenditures that exceed the amount that has been appropriated for the program in the operating budget. If it appears that continued enrollment will result in expenditures exceeding the appropriated level for a particular fiscal year, the department may freeze new enrollment in the program. Nothing in this section prevents the department from continuing enrollment in the program if there are adequate private or public funds in addition to those appropriated in the biennial budget to support the cost of such enrollment.

. The department shall establish a medical advisory committee composed of interested medical professionals and consumer liaisons with expertise in a variety of areas relevant to breast and cervical health to provide expert medical advice and guidance. The medical advisory committee shall address national, state, and local concerns regarding best practices in the field of early prevention and detection for breast and cervical cancer and assist the early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program in implementing program policy that follows the best practices of high quality health care for clinical, diagnostic, pathologic, radiological, and oncology services.
