<p>By January 1, 2009, the department, in consultation with the department of health, shall identify high priority chemicals that are of high concern for children after considering a child's or developing fetus's potential for exposure to each chemical.

a. Within one year of the department adopting a rule that identifies a flame retardant in subsection (1) of this section as a chemical of high concern for children, the department of health, in consultation with the department, must create a stakeholder advisory committee for each flame retardant chemical to provide stakeholder input, expertise, and additional information in the development of recommendations as provided under subsection (4) of this section. All advisory committee meetings must be open to the public.</p>

<li>
<p>When developing policy options and recommendations consistent with subsection (4) of this section, the department must rely on credible scientific evidence and consider information relevant to the hazards based on the quantitative extent of exposures to the chemical under its intended or reasonably anticipated conditions of use. The department of health, in consultation with the department, must include the following:</p>
<p>a. Chemical name, properties, uses, and manufacturers;</p>
<p>b. An analysis of available information on the production, unintentional production, uses, and disposal of the chemical;</p>

<p>b. When the department of health, in consultation with the department, determines that flame retardant chemicals identified in subsection (1) of this section as a chemical of high concern for children should be restricted or prohibited from use in children's products, residential upholstered furniture as defined in RCW 70A.405.010, or other commercial products or processes, the department of health must include citations of the peer-reviewed science and other sources of information reviewed and ultimately relied upon in support of the recommendation to restrict or prohibit the chemical.</p>
