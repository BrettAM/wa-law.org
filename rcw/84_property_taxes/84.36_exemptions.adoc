== 84.36.041 - Nonprofit homes for the aging.
. All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home for the aging that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt from taxation if the benefit of the exemption inures to the home and:

.. At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; or

.. The home is subsidized under a federal department of housing and urban development program. The department of revenue must provide by rule a definition of homes eligible for exemption under this subsection (1)(b), consistent with the purposes of this section.

. All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home for the aging that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt from taxation if the benefit of the exemption inures to the home and the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of the home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses the tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. The initial term of the exemption under this subsection must equal the term of the tax exempt bond used in connection with the financing program, or the term of the requirement to reserve dwelling units for low-income residents, whichever is shorter. If the financing program involves less than the entire home, only those dwelling units included in the financing program are eligible for total exemption. The department of revenue must provide by rule the requirements for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this subsection and the requirements for exemption including:

.. The number or percentage of dwelling units required to be occupied by low-income residents, and a definition of low income;

.. The type and character of the dwelling units, whether independent units or otherwise; and

.. Any particular requirements for continuing care retirement communities.

. A home for the aging is eligible for a partial exemption on the real property and a total exemption for the home's personal property if the home does not meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section because fewer than fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, as follows:

.. A partial exemption must be allowed for each dwelling unit in a home occupied by a resident requiring assistance with activities of daily living.

.. A partial exemption must be allowed for each dwelling unit in a home occupied by an eligible resident.

.. A partial exemption must be allowed for an area jointly used by a home for the aging and by a nonprofit organization, association, or corporation currently exempt from property taxation under one of the other provisions of this chapter. The shared area must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property taxation under one of the other provisions of this chapter, such as kitchen, dining, and laundry areas.

.. The amount of exemption must be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, less the assessed value of any area exempt under (c) of this subsection, by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational for which exemption is claimed and January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which exemption is claimed.

. To be exempt under this section, the property must be used exclusively for the purposes for which the exemption is granted, except as provided in RCW 84.36.805.

. A home for the aging is exempt from taxation only if the organization operating the home is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal internal revenue code as existing on January 1, 1989, or such subsequent date as the director may provide by rule consistent with the purposes of this section.

. In order for the home to be eligible for exemption under subsections (1)(a) and (3)(b) of this section, each eligible resident of a home for the aging must submit an income verification form to the county assessor by July 1st of the assessment year for which exemption is claimed. However, during the first year a home becomes operational, the county assessor must accept income verification forms from eligible residents up to December 31st of the assessment year. The income verification form must be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. An eligible resident who has filed a form for a previous year need not file a new form until there is a change in status affecting the person's eligibility.

. In determining the true and fair value of a home for the aging for purposes of the partial exemption provided by subsection (3) of this section, the assessor must apply the computation method provided by RCW 84.34.060 and may consider only the use to which such property is applied during the years for which such partial exemptions are available and may not consider potential uses of such property.

. As used in this section:

.. "Eligible resident" means a person who:

... Occupied the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational. In each subsequent year, the eligible resident must occupy the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of January 1st of the assessment year for which the exemption is claimed. Confinement of the person to a hospital or nursing home does not disqualify the claim of exemption if the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or if the dwelling unit is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; and

... Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability as defined in RCW 84.36.383. Any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death qualifies if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and

... Has a combined disposable income of no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by the federal department of housing and urban development for the county in which the person resides. For the purposes of determining eligibility under this section, a "cotenant" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident.

.. "Combined disposable income" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of his or her spouse or domestic partner, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or his or her spouse or domestic partner or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by twelve. If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or domestic partner, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after the death of the spouse or domestic partner by twelve.

.. "Disposable income" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal internal revenue code, as amended prior to January 1, 1989, or such subsequent date as the director may provide by rule consistent with the purpose of this section, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income:

... Capital gains, other than gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal internal revenue code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence;

... Amounts deducted for loss;

... Amounts deducted for depreciation;

... Pension and annuity receipts;

.. Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;

.. Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;

.. Federal social security act and railroad retirement benefits;

.. Dividend receipts; and

... Interest received on state and municipal bonds.

.. "Resident requiring assistance with activities of daily living" means a person who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and who would be at risk of nursing home placement without this assistance.

.. "Home for the aging" means a residential housing facility that (i) provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal.

. A for-profit home for the aging that converts to nonprofit status after June 11, 1992, and would otherwise be eligible for tax exemption under this section may not receive the tax exemption until five years have elapsed since the conversion. The exemption must then be ratably granted over the next five years.

== 84.36.049 - Nonprofit homeownership development. (Expires January 1, 2038.)
. All real property owned by a nonprofit entity or by a qualified cooperative association for the purpose of developing or redeveloping on the real property one or more residences to be sold to low-income households including land to be leased as provided in subsection (8)(e)(ii) of this section, is exempt from state and local property taxes.

. The exemption provided in this section expires on or at the earlier of:

.. The date on which the nonprofit entity transfers title to the single-family dwelling unit or the date on which the qualified cooperative association first conveys, directly or indirectly through the transfer of an ownership interest in the association, any single-family dwelling unit on the property or any part of the property. The exemption will not expire as a consequence of the real property being transferred by one nonprofit entity to another nonprofit entity or to a qualified cooperative association so long as the transferee timely applies to the department for a continuation of the exemption;

.. The date on which the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association executes a lease of land described in subsection (8)(e)(ii) of this section;

.. The property is no longer held for the purpose for which the exemption was granted.

. If the nonprofit entity believes that title to the single-family dwelling unit will not be transferred by the end of the sixth consecutive property tax year or if a qualified cooperative association believes that neither a single-family dwelling unit nor any other part of the property will be transferred by the end of the sixth consecutive property tax year, the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association may claim a three-year extension of the exemption period by:

.. Filing a notice of extension with the department on or before March 31st of the sixth consecutive property tax year; and

.. Providing a filing fee equal to the greater of two hundred dollars or one-tenth of one percent of the real market value of the property as of the most recent assessment date with the notice of extension. The filing fee must be deposited into the state general fund.

.. If the nonprofit entity has not transferred title to the single-family dwelling unit to a low-income household, or if a qualified cooperative association has not transferred either a single-family dwelling unit or any other property, within the applicable period described in subsection (2)(c) of this section, or if the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association has converted the property to a purpose other than the purpose for which the exemption was granted, the property is disqualified from the exemption.

.. Upon disqualification, the county treasurer must collect an additional tax equal to all taxes that would have been paid on the property but for the existence of the exemption, plus interest at the same rate and computed in the same way as that upon delinquent property taxes.

.. The additional tax must be distributed by the county treasurer in the same manner in which current property taxes applicable to the subject property are distributed. The additional taxes and interest are due in full thirty days following the date on which the treasurer's statement of additional tax due is issued.

.. The additional tax and interest is a lien on the property. The lien for additional tax and interest has priority to and must be fully paid and satisfied before any recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the property may become charged or liable.

The notice provided when all the exempt real property becomes occupied must be filed within one year of all exempt real property becoming occupied and demonstrate that the qualified cooperative association does, in fact, meet the requirements for being a qualified cooperative association.

.. The department of revenue must make the notices of occupancy available to the joint legislative audit and review committee, upon request by the committee, in order for the committee to complete its review of the tax preference in this section.

. Upon cessation of the exemption, the value of new construction and improvements to the property, not previously considered as new construction, must be considered as new construction for purposes of calculating levies under chapter 84.55 RCW. The assessed value of the property as it was valued prior to the beginning of the exemption may not be considered as new construction upon cessation of the exemption.

. Nonprofit entities and qualified cooperative associations receiving an exemption under this section must provide annual financial statements to the joint legislative audit and review committee, upon request by the committee, for the years that the exemption has been claimed.

.. The property taxes must have been imposed upon a residence which was occupied by the person claiming the exemption as a principal place of residence as of the time of filing. However, any person who sells, transfers, or is displaced from his or her residence may transfer his or her exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive an exemption on more than one residence in any year. Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, adult family home, or home of a relative for the purpose of long-term care does not disqualify the claim of exemption if:

... The residence is temporarily unoccupied;

... The residence is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner and/or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or

... The residence is rented for the purpose of paying nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home costs.

.. For the purpose of this subsection (1), "relative" means any individual related to the claimant by blood, marriage, or adoption;

. The person claiming the exemption must have owned, at the time of filing, in fee, as a life estate, or by contract purchase, the residence on which the property taxes have been imposed or if the person claiming the exemption lives in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, such person must own a share therein representing the unit or portion of the structure in which he or she resides. For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;

. [Empty]
.. The person claiming the exemption must be:

... Sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or must have been, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability; or

... A veteran of the armed forces of the United States entitled to and receiving compensation from the United States department of veterans affairs at:

(A) A combined service-connected evaluation rating of eighty percent or higher; or

(B) A total disability rating for a service-connected disability without regard to evaluation percent.

.. However, any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this section;

. The amount that the person is exempt from an obligation to pay is calculated on the basis of combined disposable income, as defined in RCW 84.36.383. If the person claiming the exemption was retired for two months or more of the assessment year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by twelve. If the income of the person claiming exemption is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or the person's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by twelve. If it is necessary to estimate income to comply with this subsection, the assessor may require confirming documentation of such income prior to May 31 of the year following application;

. [Empty]
.. A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal [to] or less than income threshold 3 is exempt from all excess property taxes, the additional state property tax imposed under RCW 84.52.065(2), and the portion of the regular property taxes authorized pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and approved by the voters, if the legislative authority of the county or city imposing the additional regular property taxes identified this exemption in the ordinance placing the RCW 84.55.050 measure on the ballot; and

.. [Empty]
... A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 2 but greater than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of fifty thousand dollars or thirty-five percent of the valuation of his or her residence, but not to exceed seventy thousand dollars of the valuation of his or her residence; or

... A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of sixty thousand dollars or sixty percent of the valuation of his or her residence;

. [Empty]
.. For a person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal [to] or less than income threshold 3, the valuation of the residence is the assessed value of the residence on the later of January 1, 1995, or January 1st of the assessment year the person first qualifies under this section. If the person subsequently fails to qualify under this section only for one year because of high income, this same valuation must be used upon requalification. If the person fails to qualify for more than one year in succession because of high income or fails to qualify for any other reason, the valuation upon requalification is the assessed value on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person requalifies. If the person transfers the exemption under this section to a different residence, the valuation of the different residence is the assessed value of the different residence on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person transfers the exemption.

.. In no event may the valuation under this subsection be greater than the true and fair value of the residence on January 1st of the assessment year.

.. This subsection does not apply to subsequent improvements to the property in the year in which the improvements are made. Subsequent improvements to the property must be added to the value otherwise determined under this subsection at their true and fair value in the year in which they are made.

== 84.36.385 - Residences—Claim for exemption—Forms—Change of status—Publication and notice of qualifications and manner of making claims.
. A claim for exemption under RCW 84.36.381 as now or hereafter amended, may be made and filed at any time during the year for exemption from taxes payable the following year and thereafter and solely upon forms as prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. However, an exemption from tax under RCW 84.36.381 continues for no more than six years unless a renewal application is filed as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

. A person granted an exemption under RCW 84.36.381 must inform the county assessor of any change in status affecting the person's entitlement to the exemption on forms prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue.

. Each person exempt from taxes under RCW 84.36.381 in 1993 and thereafter must file with the county assessor a renewal application not later than December 31 of the year the assessor notifies such person of the requirement to file the renewal application. Renewal applications must be on forms prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue.

. At least once every six years, the county assessor must notify those persons receiving an exemption from taxes under RCW 84.36.381 of the requirement to file a renewal application. The county assessor may also require a renewal application following an amendment of the income requirements set forth in RCW 84.36.381.

. If the assessor finds that the applicant does not meet the qualifications as set forth in RCW 84.36.381, as now or hereafter amended, the claim or exemption must be denied but such denial is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW 84.48.010 and in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038. If the applicant had received exemption in prior years based on erroneous information, the taxes must be collected subject to penalties as provided in RCW 84.40.130 for a period of not to exceed five years.

. The department and each local assessor is hereby directed to publicize the qualifications and manner of making claims under RCW 84.36.381 through 84.36.389, through communications media, including such paid advertisements or notices as it deems appropriate. Notice of the qualifications, method of making applications, the penalties for not reporting a change in status, and availability of further information must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for all residential property including mobile homes, except rental properties.

. The department must authorize an option for electronic filing of applications and renewal applications for the exemption under RCW 84.36.381.

. Beginning August 1, 2019, and by March 1st every fifth year thereafter, the department must publish updated income thresholds. The adjusted thresholds must be rounded up to the nearest one thousand dollars. If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply. The department must adjust income thresholds for each county to reflect the most recent year available of estimated county median household incomes, including preliminary estimates or projections, as published by the office of financial management. For the purposes of this subsection, "county median household income" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 84.36.383.

. Beginning with the adjustment made by March 1, 2024, as provided in subsection (8) of this section, and every second adjustment thereafter, if an income threshold in a county is not adjusted based on percentage of county median income, then the income threshold must be adjusted based on the growth of the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the prior twelve month period as published by the United States bureau of labor statistics.

. If at the time of initial application the property is unoccupied, or subsequent to the initial application the property is unoccupied because of renovations, and the property is not currently being used for the exempt purpose authorized by this section but will be used for the exempt purpose within two assessment years, the property shall be eligible for a property tax exemption for the assessment year in which the claim for exemption is submitted under the following conditions:

.. A commitment for financing to acquire, construct, renovate, or otherwise convert the property to provide housing for qualifying households has been obtained, in whole or in part, by the nonprofit entity claiming the exemption from one or more of the sources listed in subsection (1)(c) of this section;

.. The nonprofit entity has manifested its intent in writing to construct, remodel, or otherwise convert the property to housing for qualifying households; and

.. Only the portion of property that will be used to provide housing or lots for qualifying households shall be exempt under this section.

. The nonprofit entity qualifying for a property tax exemption under this section may agree to make payments to the city, county, or other political subdivision for improvements, services, and facilities furnished by the city, county, or political subdivision for the benefit of the rental housing. However, these payments shall not exceed the amount last levied as the annual tax of the city, county, or political subdivision upon the property prior to exemption.

. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

.. "Group home" means a single-family dwelling financed, in whole or in part, by one or more of the sources listed in subsection (1)(c) of this section.

The individual incomes of the residents shall not be aggregated for purposes of this exemption;

.. "Mobile home lot" or "mobile home park" means the same as these terms are defined in RCW 59.20.030;
