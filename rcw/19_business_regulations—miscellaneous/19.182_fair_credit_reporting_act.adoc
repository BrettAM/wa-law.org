:toc:

== 19.182.005 - Findings—Declaration.
The legislature finds and declares that consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining creditworthiness. The legislature further finds that an elaborate mechanism using credit reports has developed for investigating and evaluating a consumer's creditworthiness, credit capacity, and general reputation and character. As such, credit reports are used for evaluating credit card, loan, mortgage, and small business financing applications, as well as for decisions regarding employment and the rental or leasing of dwellings. Moreover, financial institutions and other creditors depend upon fair and accurate credit reports to efficiently and accurately evaluate creditworthiness. Unfair or inaccurate reports undermine both public and creditor confidences in the reliability of credit granting systems.

Therefore, this chapter is necessary to assure accurate credit data collection, maintenance, and reporting on the citizens of the state. It is the policy of the state that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate credit reports, resolve disputed reports promptly and fairly, and adopt reasonable procedures to promote consumer confidentiality and the proper use of credit data in accordance with this chapter.

The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Violations of this chapter are not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business. A violation of this chapter is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. The burden of proof in an action alleging a violation of this chapter shall be by a preponderance of the evidence, and the applicable statute of limitation shall be as set forth in RCW 19.182.120. For purposes of a judgment awarded pursuant to an action by a consumer under chapter 19.86 RCW, the consumer shall be awarded actual damages and costs of the action together with reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court. However, where there has been willful failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter, the consumer shall be awarded actual damages, a monetary penalty of one thousand dollars, and the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by the court.

== 19.182.160 - Block of information appearing as result of identity theft.
. Within thirty days of receipt of proof of the consumer's identification and a copy of a police report, filed by the consumer, evidencing the consumer's claim to be a victim of a violation of RCW 9.35.020, a consumer reporting agency shall permanently block reporting any information the consumer identifies on his or her consumer report is a result of a violation of RCW 9.35.020, so that the information cannot be reported, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of the information that a police report has been filed, that a block has been requested, and the effective date of the block.

. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block or may rescind any block of consumer information if, in the exercise of good faith and reasonable judgment, the consumer reporting agency believes:

.. The information was blocked due to a misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block under this section;

.. The consumer agrees that the blocked information or portions of the blocked information were blocked in error; or

.. The consumer knowingly obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions or the consumer should have known that he or she obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.

. If the block of information is declined or rescinded under this section, the consumer shall be notified promptly in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information pursuant to section 611 of the fair credit reporting act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i, as amended. The prior presence of the blocked information in the consumer reporting agency's file on the consumer is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that he or she obtained possession of any goods, services, or moneys.

. In order to facilitate the exercise of a consumer's right to block information in his or her consumer report, all police and sheriff's departments in Washington state shall provide to the consumer, at the consumer's request, a copy of any police report, filed by the consumer, evidencing the consumer's claim to be a victim of a violation of RCW 9.35.020.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a law enforcement agency to investigate reports claiming identity theft.

If a security freeze is in place, information from a consumer's credit report may not be released to a third party without prior express authorization from the consumer. This subsection does not prevent a consumer reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect with respect to the consumer's credit report.

. The consumer reporting agency shall send a confirmation of the security freeze to the consumer within ten business days and shall provide the consumer with a unique personal identification number or password to be used by the consumer when providing authorization for the release of his or her credit report for a specific party or period of time.

. If the consumer wishes to allow his or her credit report to be accessed for a specific period of time while a freeze is in place, he or she shall contact the consumer reporting agency, request that the freeze be temporarily lifted, and provide the following:

.. Proper identification, which means that information generally deemed sufficient to identify a person. Only if the consumer is unable to sufficiently identify himself or herself, may a consumer reporting agency require additional information concerning the consumer's employment and personal or family history in order to verify his or her identity;

.. The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency under subsection (4) of this section; and

.. Three business days of receiving the request by mail; or

.. Fifteen minutes of receiving the request from the consumer through the electronic contact method chosen by the consumer reporting agency in accordance with subsection (8) of this section, if the request:

... Is received during normal business hours; and

... Includes the consumer's proper identification and correct personal identification number or password.

. A consumer reporting agency is not required to remove a security freeze within the time provided in subsection (6)(b) of this section if:

.. The consumer fails to meet the requirements of subsection (5) of this section; or

.. The consumer reporting agency's ability to remove the security freeze within fifteen minutes is prevented by:

... An act of God, including fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, or similar natural disasters or phenomena;

... Unauthorized or illegal acts by a third party, including terrorism, sabotage, riot, vandalism, labor strikes, or disputes disrupting operations, or similar occurrences;

... An interruption in operations, including electrical failure, unanticipated delay in equipment or replacement part delivery, computer hardware or software failures inhibiting response time, or similar disruptions;

... Governmental action, including emergency orders or regulations, judicial or law enforcement action, or similar directives;

.. Regularly scheduled maintenance of, or updates to, the consumer reporting agency's systems outside of normal business hours;

.. Commercially reasonable maintenance of, or repair to, the consumer reporting agency's systems that is unexpected or unscheduled; or

.. Receipt of a removal request outside of normal business hours.

. A consumer reporting agency may develop procedures involving the use of telephone, fax, the internet, or other electronic media to receive and process a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report under subsection (5) of this section in an expedited manner.

. A consumer reporting agency shall remove or temporarily lift a freeze placed on a consumer's credit report only in the following cases:

.. Upon consumer request, under subsection (5) or (12) of this section; or

.. When the consumer's credit report was frozen due to a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer. When a consumer reporting agency intends to remove a freeze upon a consumer's credit report under this subsection, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer in writing prior to removing the freeze on the consumer's credit report.

. When a third party requests access to a consumer credit report on which a security freeze is in effect, and this request is in connection with an application for credit or any other use, and the consumer does not allow his or her credit report to be accessed for that period of time, the third party may treat the application as incomplete.

. When a consumer requests a security freeze, the consumer reporting agency shall disclose the process of placing and temporarily lifting a freeze, and the process for allowing access to information from the consumer's credit report for a specific period of time while the freeze is in place.

. A security freeze remains in place until the consumer requests that the security freeze be removed. A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze within three business days of receiving a request for removal from the consumer, who provides all of the following:

.. Proper identification, as defined in subsection (5)(a) of this section; and

.. The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency under subsection (4) of this section.

. A consumer reporting agency may not charge a fee for any service under this section including, but not limited to, placing a security freeze, assigning a unique personal identification number or password, temporarily lifting a security freeze, or removing a security freeze.

. This section does not apply to the use of a consumer credit report by any of the following:

.. A person or entity, or a subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of that person or entity, or an assignee of a financial obligation owing by the consumer to that person or entity, or a prospective assignee of a financial obligation owing by the consumer to that person or entity in conjunction with the proposed purchase of the financial obligation, with which the consumer has or had prior to assignment an account or contract, including a demand deposit account, or to whom the consumer issued a negotiable instrument, for the purposes of reviewing the account or collecting the financial obligation owing for the account, contract, or negotiable instrument. For purposes of this subsection, "reviewing the account" includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements;

Liability may not result to the consumer reporting agency if through inadvertence or mistake the consumer reporting agency releases credit report information to a person or entity purporting to be a mortgage broker or loan originator under subsection (14) of this section that is, in fact, not a mortgage broker or loan originator.

. The consumer's request for a security freeze does not prohibit the consumer reporting agency from disclosing the consumer's credit report for other than credit-related purposes.

. A violation of subsection (6) of this section does not provide a private cause of action under RCW 19.86.090. A violation of subsection (6) of this section shall be enforced exclusively by the attorney general. A violation of subsection (6) of this section is subject to all other remedies and penalties available under this chapter.
