.. In the case of an article manufactured or produced for purposes of serving as a prototype for the development of a new or improved product, the value of the article used is determined by: (i) The retail selling price of such new or improved product when first offered for sale; or (ii) the value of materials incorporated into the prototype in cases in which the new or improved product is not offered for sale.

. A seller is entitled to a credit or refund for use taxes previously paid on bad debts, as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 166, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003.

.. Expenses incurred in attempting to collect debt;

.. Debts sold or assigned by the seller to third parties, where the third party is without recourse against the seller; and

.. Repossessed property.

. If a credit or refund of use tax is taken for a bad debt and the debt is subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in which the collection is made.

. Payments on a previously claimed bad debt are applied first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales or use tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other charges.

. If the seller uses a certified service provider as defined in RCW 82.32.020 to administer its use tax responsibilities, the certified service provider may claim, on behalf of the seller, the credit or refund allowed by this section. The certified service provider must credit or refund the full amount received to the seller.

. A person's right to claim a credit or refund under this section is not assignable. No person other than the original seller in the transaction that generated the bad debt or, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a certified service provider, is entitled to claim a credit or refund under this section. If the original seller in the transaction that generated the bad debt has sold or assigned the debt instrument to a third party with recourse, the original seller may claim a credit or refund under this section only after the debt instrument is reassigned by the third party to the original seller.

== 82.12.040 - Retailers to collect tax—Penalty.
. Every person who is subject to a collection obligation under chapter 82.08 RCW must obtain from the department a certificate of registration. Such persons must, at the time of making sales of tangible personal property, digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, extended warranties, or sales of any service defined as a retail sale in RCW 82.04.050 (2) (a) or (g) or (6)(c), or making transfers of either possession or title, or both, of tangible personal property for use in this state, collect from the purchasers or transferees the tax imposed under this chapter. The tax to be collected under this section must be in an amount equal to the purchase price multiplied by the rate in effect for the retail sales tax under RCW 82.08.020. This section does not apply to any retail sale if, in respect to such sale, the seller is subject to a tax collection obligation under chapter 82.08 RCW.

. Every person who engages in this state in the business of acting as an independent selling agent for persons who do not hold a valid certificate of registration, and who receives compensation by reason of sales of tangible personal property, digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, extended warranties, or sales of any service defined as a retail sale in RCW 82.04.050 (2) (a) or (g) or (6)(c), of his or her principals for use in this state, must, at the time such sales are made, collect from the purchasers the tax imposed on the purchase price under this chapter, and for that purpose is deemed a retailer as defined in this chapter.

. The tax required to be collected by this chapter is deemed to be held in trust by the retailer until paid to the department, and any retailer who appropriates or converts the tax collected to the retailer's own use or to any use other than the payment of the tax provided herein to the extent that the money required to be collected is not available for payment on the due date as prescribed is guilty of a misdemeanor. In case any seller fails to collect the tax herein imposed or having collected the tax, fails to pay the same to the department in the manner prescribed, whether such failure is the result of the seller's own acts or the result of acts or conditions beyond the seller's control, the seller is nevertheless personally liable to the state for the amount of such tax, unless the seller has taken from the buyer a copy of a direct pay permit issued under RCW 82.32.087.

. Any retailer who refunds, remits, or rebates to a purchaser, or transferee, either directly or indirectly, and by whatever means, all or any part of the tax levied by this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor.

. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (4) of this section, any person making sales is not obligated to collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the person would have been obligated to collect retail sales tax on the sale absent a specific exemption provided in chapter 82.08 RCW, and there is no corresponding use tax exemption in this chapter. Nothing in this subsection (5) may be construed as relieving purchasers from liability for reporting and remitting the tax due under this chapter directly to the department.

== 82.12.045 - Collection of tax on vehicles by county auditor or director of licensing—Remittance.
. In the collection of the use tax on vehicles, the department of revenue may designate the county auditors of the several counties of the state as its collecting agents. Upon such designation, it shall be the duty of each county auditor to collect the tax at the time an applicant applies for transfer of certificate of title to the vehicle, except when the applicant:

.. Exhibits a dealer's report of sale showing that the retail sales tax has been collected by the dealer;

.. Presents a valid reseller permit issued to the vehicle owner by the department of revenue under the authority of RCW 82.32.780;

.. Presents a written statement signed by the department of revenue, or its duly authorized agent showing that no use tax is legally due; or

.. Presents satisfactory evidence showing that the retail sales tax or the use tax has been paid by the applicant on the vehicle in question.

. As used in this section, "vehicle" has the same meaning as in RCW 46.04.670.

. It shall be the duty of every applicant for registration and transfer of certificate of title who is subject to payment of tax under this section to declare upon the application the value of the vehicle for which application is made, which shall consist of the consideration paid or contracted to be paid therefor.

. Each county auditor who acts as agent of the department of revenue shall at the time of remitting vehicle license fee receipts on vehicles subject to the provisions of this section pay over and account to the state treasurer for all use tax revenue collected under this section, after first deducting as a collection fee the sum of two dollars for each motor vehicle upon which the tax has been collected. All revenue received by the state treasurer under this section shall be credited to the general fund. The auditor's collection fee shall be deposited in the county current expense fund. A duplicate of the county auditor's transmittal report to the state treasurer shall be forwarded forthwith to the department of revenue.

. Any applicant who has paid use tax to a county auditor under this section may apply to the department of revenue for refund thereof if he or she has reason to believe that such tax was not legally due and owing. No refund shall be allowed unless application therefor is received by the department of revenue within the statutory period for assessment of taxes, penalties, or interest prescribed by RCW 82.32.050(4). Upon receipt of an application for refund the department of revenue shall consider the same and issue its order either granting or denying it and if refund is denied the taxpayer shall have the right of appeal as provided in RCW 82.32.170, 82.32.180, and 82.32.190.

. The provisions of this section shall be construed as cumulative of other methods prescribed in chapters 82.04 through 82.32 RCW, inclusive, for the collection of the tax imposed by this chapter. The department of revenue shall have power to promulgate such rules as may be necessary to administer the provisions of this section. Any duties required by this section to be performed by the county auditor may be performed by the director of licensing but no collection fee shall be deductible by said director in remitting use tax revenue to the state treasurer.

. The use tax revenue collected on the rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(3) shall be deposited in the multimodal transportation account under RCW 47.66.070.
