. Also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest.

.. Purchase-money security interest in software. A security interest in software is a purchase-money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest if:

. The debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods; and

. The debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods.

.. Consignor's inventory purchase-money security interest. The security interest of a consignor in goods that are the subject of a consignment is a purchase-money security interest in inventory.

.. Application of payment in nonconsumer-goods transaction. In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, if the extent to which a security interest is a purchase-money security interest depends on the application of a payment to a particular obligation, the payment must be applied:

. In accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree;

. In the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment; or

. In the absence of an agreement to a reasonable method and a timely manifestation of the obligor's intention, in the following order:

(A) To obligations that are not secured; and

(B) If more than one obligation is secured, to obligations secured by purchase-money security interests in the order in which those obligations were incurred.

.. No loss of status of purchase-money security interest in nonconsumer-goods transaction. In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a purchase-money security interest does not lose its status as such, even if:

. The purchase-money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase-money obligation;

. Collateral that is not purchase-money collateral also secures the purchase-money obligation; or

. The purchase-money obligation has been renewed, refinanced, consolidated, or restructured.

.. Burden of proof in nonconsumer-goods transaction. In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a secured party claiming a purchase-money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase-money security interest.

.. Nonconsumer-goods transactions; no inference. The limitation of the rules in subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this section to transactions other than consumer-goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer-goods transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer-goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

== 62A.9A-316 - Effect of change in governing law.
.. General rule: Effect on perfection of change in governing law. A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in RCW 62A.9A-301(1) or 62A.9A-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest of:

. The time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;

. The expiration of four months after a change of the debtor's location to another jurisdiction; or

. The expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.

.. Security interest perfected or unperfected under law of new jurisdiction. If a security interest described in subsection (a) of this section becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in subsection (a) of this section, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

.. Possessory security interest in collateral moved to new jurisdiction. A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods, remains continuously perfected if:

. The collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;

. Thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction; and

. Upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.

.. Goods covered by certificate of title from this state. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate of title from this state remains perfected until the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become so covered.

.. When subsection (d) security interest becomes unperfected against purchasers. A security interest described in subsection (d) of this section becomes unperfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable requirements for perfection under RCW 62A.9A-311(b) or 62A.9A-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of:

. The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate of title from this state; or

. The expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered.

.. Change in jurisdiction of bank, issuer, nominated person, securities intermediary, or commodity intermediary. A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction, the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:

. The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of that jurisdiction; or

. The expiration of four months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction to another jurisdiction.

.. Subsection (f) of this section security interestperfected or unperfected under law of new jurisdiction. If a security interest described in subsection (f) of this section becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or the end of the period described in subsection (f) of this section, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

.. Effect on filed financing statement of change in governing law. The following rules apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within four months after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:

. A financing statement filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in RCW 62A.9A-301(1) or 62A.9A-305(c) is effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the debtor not changed its location.

. If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective under (1) of this subsection (h) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in RCW 62A.9A-301(1) or 62A.9A-305(c) or the expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

... Effect of change in governing law on financing statement filed against original debtor. If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in RCW 62A.9A-301(1) or 62A.9A-305(c) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:

. The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under RCW 62A.9A-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the collateral been acquired by the original debtor.

. A security interest perfected by the financing statement and which becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in RCW 62A.9A-301(1) or 62A.9A-305(c) or the expiration of the four-month period remains perfected thereafter. A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement but which does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

.. Applicability of other law. For purposes of determining the rights of a creditor of a consignee, law other than this Article determines the rights and title of a consignee while goods are in the consignee's possession if, under this part, a perfected security interest held by the consignor would have priority over the rights of the creditor.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-319; ]

== 62A.9A-322 - Priorities among conflicting security interests in and agricultural liens on same collateral.
.. General priority rules. Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules:

. Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.

. A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.

. The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.

.. Time of perfection: Proceeds and supporting obligations. For the purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section:

. The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and

. The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.

.. Special priority rules: Proceeds and supporting obligations.

(A) The security interest in proceeds is perfected;

(B) The proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and

(C) In the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.

Subject to subsection (e) of this section and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.

.. Applicability of subsection (d) of this section. Subsection (d) of this section applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.

.. Limitations on subsections (a) through (e) of this section. Subsections (a) through (e) of this section are subject to:

. Subsection (g) of this section and the other provisions of this part;

. Is made while the security interest is perfected only:

(A) Under RCW 62A.9A-309 when it attaches; or

(B) Temporarily under RCW 62A.9A-312 (e), (f), or (g); and

. The purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the livestock;

. The purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest;

. The holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within six months before the debtor receives possession of the livestock; and

.. Conflicting purchase-money security interests. If more than one security interest qualifies for priority in the same collateral under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (f) of this section:

. A security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral; and

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-325; ]

== 62A.9A-326 - Priority of security interests created by new debtor.
.. Subordination of security interest created by new debtor. Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a security interest that is created by a new debtor in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights and is perfected solely by a filed financing statement that would be ineffective to perfect the security interest but for the application of RCW 62A.9A-316(i)(1) or 62A.9A-508 is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by such a filed financing statement.

.. Priority under other provisions; multiple original debtors.

The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it.

Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note.

.. Inapplicability of subsection (d) of this section to certain sales. Subsection (d) of this section does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under RCW 62A.9A-610 or an acceptance of collateral under RCW 62A.9A-620.

== 62A.9A-407 - Restrictions on creation or enforcement of security interest in leasehold interest or in lessor's residual interest.
.. Term restricting assignment generally ineffective. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a term in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it:

. Prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods; or

. Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the lease.

.. Effectiveness of certain terms. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.2A-303(7), a term described in subsection (a)(2) of this section is effective to the extent that there is:

. A transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term; or

. A delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term.

.. Security interest not material impairment. The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the lessor's residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of RCW 62A.2A-303(4) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor.

. Would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or

. Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

.. Applicability of subsection (a) of this section to sales of certain rights to payment. Subsection (a) of this section applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under RCW 62A.9A-610 or an acceptance of collateral under RCW 62A.9A-620.

.. Legal restrictions on assignment generally ineffective. A rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, person obligated on a promissory note, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, a promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise between an account debtor and a debtor, is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation:

. Would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or

. Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

. Is not enforceable against the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor;

== 62A.9A-409 - Restrictions on assignment of letter-of-credit rights ineffective.
.. Term or law restricting assignment generally ineffective. A term in a letter of credit or a rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice applicable to the letter of credit which prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of an applicant, issuer, or nominated person to a beneficiary's assignment of or creation of a security interest in a letter-of-credit right is ineffective to the extent that the term or rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice:

. Would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter-of-credit right; or

. Provides that the assignment or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the letter-of-credit right.

== 62A.9A-501 - Filing office.
.. Filing offices. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, if the local law of this state governs perfection of a security interest or agricultural lien, the office in which to file a financing statement to perfect the security interest or agricultural lien is:

. The office designated for the filing or recording of a record of a mortgage on the related real property, if:

(A) The collateral is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut; or

(B) The financing statement is filed as a fixture filing and the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures; or

. The department of licensing, in all other cases, including a case in which the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures and the financing statement is not filed as a fixture filing.

.. Filing office for transmitting utilities. The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the department of licensing. The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement which is or is to become fixtures.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-501; ]

== 62A.9A-502 - Contents of financing statement; record of mortgage as financing statement; time of filing financing statement.
.. Sufficiency of financing statement. Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a financing statement is sufficient only if it:

. Provides the name of the debtor;

. Provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party; and

. Indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement.

.. Real-property-related financing statements. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-501(b), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or which is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy subsection (a) of this section and also:

. Indicate that it covers this type of collateral;

. Indicate that it is to be filed for record in the real property records;

. Provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this state if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property; and

. If the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner.

.. Record of mortgage as financing statement. A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if:

. The record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers;

. The goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;

. The record satisfies the requirements for a financing statement in this section, but:

(A) The record need not indicate that it is to be filed in the real property records; and

(B) The record sufficiently provides the name of a debtor who is an individual if it provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor, even if the debtor is an individual to whom RCW 62A.9A-503(a)(4) applies; and

. The record is recorded.

.. Filing before security agreement or attachment. A financing statement may be filed before a security agreement is made or a security interest otherwise attaches.

== 62A.9A-503 - Name of debtor and secured party.
.. Sufficiency of debtor's name. A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:

. Except as otherwise provided in (3) of this subsection (a), if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization's name;

. Subject to subsection (f) of this section, if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;

. If the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:

(A) Provides, as the name of the debtor:

... If the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified; or

... If the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator; and

(B) In a separate part of the financing statement:

... If the name is provided in accordance with (3)(A)(i) of this subsection, indicates that the collateral is held in a trust; or

... If the name is provided in accordance with (3)(A)(ii) of this subsection, provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates;

. Subject to subsection (g) of this section, if the debtor is an individual to whom this state has issued a driver's license or identification card that has not expired, only if the financing statement provides the name of the individual which is indicated on the driver's license or identification card;

. If the debtor is an individual to whom (4) of this subsection (a) does not apply, only if the financing statement provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor; and

. In other cases:

(A) If the debtor has a name, only if the financing statement provides the organizational name of the debtor; and

(B) If the debtor does not have a name, only if the financing statement provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor, in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.

.. Additional debtor-related information. A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) of this section is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:

. A trade name or other name of the debtor; or

. Unless required under subsection (a)(6)(B) of this section, names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor.

.. Debtor's trade name insufficient. A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.

.. Representative capacity. Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.

.. Multiple debtors and secured parties. A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party.

.. Name of decedent. The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of the decedent issued by the court having jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the "name of the decedent" under subsection (a)(2) of this section.

.. Multiple driver's licenses. If this state has issued to an individual more than one driver's license or identification card of a kind described in subsection (a)(4) of this section, the one that was issued most recently is the one to which subsection (a)(4) of this section refers.

.. Definition. In this section, the "name of the settlor or testator" means:

. If the settlor is a registered organization, the name that is stated to be the settlor's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the settlor's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the settlor's name; or

. In other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust's organic record.

== 62A.9A-504 - Indication of collateral.
A financing statement sufficiently indicates the collateral that it covers if the financing statement provides:

. A description of the collateral pursuant to RCW 62A.9A-108; or

. An indication that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-504; ]

== 62A.9A-505 - Filing and compliance with other statutes and treaties for consignments, leases, other bailments, and other transactions.
.. Use of terms other than "debtor" and "secured party." A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in RCW 62A.9A-311(a), using the terms "consignor," "consignee," "lessor," "lessee," "bailor," "bailee," "licensor," "licensee," "owner," "registered owner," "buyer," "seller," or words of similar import, instead of the terms "secured party" and "debtor."

.. Effect of financing statement under subsection (a) of this section. This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) of this section and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under RCW 62A.9A-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.

== 62A.9A-506 - Effect of errors or omissions.
.. Minor errors and omissions. A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.

.. Financing statement seriously misleading. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with RCW 62A.9A-503(a) is seriously misleading.

.. Financing statement not seriously misleading. If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with RCW 62A.9A-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.

.. "Debtor's correct name." For purposes of RCW 62A.9A-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in subsection (c) of this section means the correct name of the new debtor.

[ http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1492-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2074%20§%20718[2011 c 74 § 718]; 2000 c 250 § 9A-506; ]

== 62A.9A-507 - Effect of certain events on effectiveness of financing statement.
.. Disposition. A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.

.. Information becoming seriously misleading. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section and RCW 62A.9A-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under RCW 62A.9A-506.

.. Change in debtor's name. If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under RCW 62A.9A-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under RCW 62A.9A-506:

. The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and

. The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading.

== 62A.9A-508 - Effectiveness of financing statement if new debtor becomes bound by security agreement.
.. Financing statement naming original debtor. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the collateral.

.. Financing statement becoming seriously misleading. If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection (a) of this section to be seriously misleading under RCW 62A.9A-506:

. The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under RCW 62A.9A-203(d); and

. The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor more than four months after the new debtor becomes bound under RCW 62A.9A-203(d) unless an initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time.

.. When section not applicable. This section does not apply to collateral as to which a filed financing statement remains effective against the new debtor under RCW 62A.9A-507(a).

== 62A.9A-509 - Persons entitled to file a record.
.. Person entitled to file record. A person may file an initial financing statement, amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement, or amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if:

. The debtor authorizes the filing in an authenticated record or pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section; or

. The person holds an agricultural lien that has become effective at the time of filing and the financing statement covers only collateral in which the person holds an agricultural lien.

.. Security agreement as authorization. By authenticating or becoming bound as debtor by a security agreement, a debtor or new debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering:

. The collateral described in the security agreement; and

. Property that becomes collateral under RCW 62A.9A-315(a)(2), whether or not the security agreement expressly covers proceeds.

.. Acquisition of collateral as authorization. By acquiring collateral in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues under RCW 62A.9A-315(a)(1), a debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering the collateral and property that becomes collateral under RCW 62A.9A-315(a)(2).

.. Person entitled to file certain amendments. A person may file an amendment other than an amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement or an amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if:

. The secured party of record authorizes the filing; or

. The amendment is a termination statement for a financing statement as to which the secured party of record has failed to file or send a termination statement as required by RCW 62A.9A-513 (a) or (c), the debtor authorizes the filing, and the termination statement indicates that the debtor authorized it to be filed.

.. Multiple secured parties of record. If there is more than one secured party of record for a financing statement, each secured party of record may authorize the filing of an amendment under subsection (d) of this section.

== 62A.9A-510 - Effectiveness of filed record.
.. Filed record effective if authorized. A filed record is effective only to the extent that it was filed by a person that may file it under RCW 62A.9A-509.

.. Authorization by one secured party of record. A record authorized by one secured party of record does not affect the financing statement with respect to another secured party of record.

.. Continuation statement not timely filed. A continuation statement that is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by RCW 62A.9A-515(d) is ineffective.

== 62A.9A-511 - Secured party of record.
.. Secured party of record. A secured party of record with respect to a financing statement is a person whose name is provided as the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party in an initial financing statement that has been filed. If an initial financing statement is filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(a), the assignee named in the initial financing statement is the secured party of record with respect to the financing statement.

.. Amendment naming secured party of record. If an amendment of a financing statement which provides the name of a person as a secured party or a representative of a secured party is filed, the person named in the amendment is a secured party of record. If an amendment is filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(b), the assignee named in the amendment is a secured party of record.

.. Amendment deleting secured party of record. A person remains a secured party of record until the filing of an amendment of the financing statement which deletes the person.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-511; ]

== 62A.9A-512 - Amendment of financing statement.
.. Amendment of information in financing statement. Subject to RCW 62A.9A-509, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or, subject to subsection (e) of this section, otherwise amend the information provided in, a financing statement by filing an amendment that:

. Identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which the amendment relates; and

. If the amendment relates to an initial financing statement filed or recorded in a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1), provides the information specified in RCW 62A.9A-502(b).

.. Period of effectiveness not affected. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-515, the filing of an amendment does not extend the period of effectiveness of the financing statement.

.. Effectiveness of amendment adding collateral. A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds collateral is effective as to the added collateral only from the date of the filing of the amendment.

.. Effectiveness of amendment adding debtor. A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds a debtor is effective as to the added debtor only from the date of the filing of the amendment.

.. Certain amendments ineffective. An amendment is ineffective to the extent it:

. Purports to delete all debtors and fails to provide the name of a debtor to be covered by the financing statement; or

. Purports to delete all secured parties of record and fails to provide the name of a new secured party of record.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-512; ]

== 62A.9A-513 - Termination statement.
.. Consumer goods. A secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to file a termination statement for the financing statement if the financing statement covers consumer goods and:

. There is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or

. The debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement.

.. Time for compliance with subsection (a) of this section. To comply with subsection (a) of this section, a secured party shall cause the secured party of record to file the termination statement:

. Within one month after there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or

. If earlier, within twenty days after the secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor.

.. Other collateral. In cases not governed by subsection (a) of this section, within twenty days after a secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor, the secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to send to the debtor a termination statement for the financing statement or file the termination statement in the filing office if:

. Except in the case of a financing statement covering accounts or chattel paper that has been sold or goods that are the subject of a consignment, there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value;

. The financing statement covers accounts or chattel paper that has been sold but as to which the account debtor or other person obligated has discharged its obligation;

. The financing statement covers goods that were the subject of a consignment to the debtor but are not in the debtor's possession; or

. The debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement.

.. Effect of filing termination statement. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-510, upon the filing of a termination statement with the filing office, the financing statement to which the termination statement relates ceases to be effective. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-510, for purposes of RCW 62A.9A-519(g), 62A.9A-522(a), and 62A.9A-523(c), the filing with the filing office of a termination statement relating to a financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a transmitting utility also causes the effectiveness of the financing statement to lapse.

== 62A.9A-514 - Assignment of powers of secured party of record.
.. Assignment reflected on initial financing statement. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, an initial financing statement may reflect an assignment of all of the secured party's power to authorize an amendment to the financing statement by providing the name and mailing address of the assignee as the name and address of the secured party.

.. Assignment of filed financing statement. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, a secured party of record may assign of record all or part of its power to authorize an amendment to a financing statement by filing in the filing office an amendment of the financing statement which:

. Identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which it relates;

. Provides the name of the assignor; and

. Provides the name and mailing address of the assignee.

.. Assignment of record of mortgage. An assignment of record of a security interest in a fixture covered by a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under RCW 62A.9A-502(c) may be made only by an assignment of record of the mortgage in the manner provided by law of this state other than the Uniform Commercial Code.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-514; ]

== 62A.9A-515 - Duration and effectiveness of financing statement; effect of lapsed financing statement.
.. Five-year effectiveness. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, a filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing.

.. [Reserved]

.. Lapse and continuation of financing statement. The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

.. When continuation statement may be filed. A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) of this section or the thirty-year period specified in subsection (b) of this section, whichever is applicable.

.. Effect of filing continuation statement. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c) of this section, unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.

.. Transmitting utility financing statement. If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.

.. Record of mortgage as financing statement. A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under RCW 62A.9A-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.

[ http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1492-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2074%20§%20403[2011 c 74 § 403]; 2000 c 250 § 9A-515; ]

== 62A.9A-516 - What constitutes filing; effectiveness of filing.
.. What constitutes filing. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, communication of a record to a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes filing.

.. Refusal to accept record; filing does not occur. Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a filing office refuses to accept because:

. The record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office;

. An amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered or, in the case of a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1), an amount equal to the applicable filing fee is not tendered;

. The filing office is unable to index the record because:

(A) In the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor;

(B) In the case of an amendment or information statement, the record:

... Does not identify the initial financing statement as required by RCW 62A.9A-512 or 62A.9A-518, as applicable; or

... Identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under RCW 62A.9A-515;

(C) In the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor's surname; or

(D) In the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1), the record does not provide a name for the debtor or a sufficient description of the real property to which the record relates;

. In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record;

. In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not:

(A) Provide a mailing address for the debtor; or

(B) Indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization;

. In the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under RCW 62A.9A-514(a) or an amendment filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(b), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee; or

. In the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by RCW 62A.9A-515(d).

.. Rules applicable to subsection (b) of this section. For purposes of subsection (b) of this section:

. A record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and

. A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by RCW 62A.9A-512, 62A.9A-514, or 62A.9A-518, is an initial financing statement.

.. Refusal to accept record; record effective as filed record. A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b) of this section, is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files.

== 62A.9A-517 - Effect of indexing errors.
The failure of the filing office to index a record correctly does not affect the effectiveness of the filed record.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-517; ]

== 62A.9A-518 - Claim concerning inaccurate or wrongfully filed record.
.. Statement with respect to recordindexed under person's name. A person may file in the filing office an information statement with respect to a record indexed there under the person's name if the person believes that the record is inaccurate or was wrongfully filed.

A person may file in the filing office an information statement with respect to a record filed there if the person is a secured party of record with respect to the financing statement to which the record relates and believes that the person that filed the record was not entitled to do so under RCW 62A.9A-509(d).

.. Contents of statement under subsection (e) of this section. An information statement under subsection (c) of this section must:

. Identify the record to which it relates by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates;

. Indicate that it is an information statement; and

. Provide the basis for the person's belief that the person that filed the record was not entitled to do so under RCW 62A.9A-509(d).

.. Record not affected by information statement. The filing of an information statement does not affect the effectiveness of an initial financing statement or other filed record.

[ http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1492-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2074%20§%20405[2011 c 74 § 405]; 2000 c 250 § 9A-518; ]

.. Filing office duties. For each record filed in a filing office, the filing office shall:

. Assign a unique number to the filed record;

. Create a record that bears the number assigned to the filed record and the date and time of filing;

. Maintain the filed record for public inspection; and

. Index the filed record in accordance with subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section.

.. File number. A file number assigned after January 1, 2002, must include a digit that:

. Aids the filing office in determining whether a number communicated as the file number includes a single-digit or transpositional error.

.. Indexing: General. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the filing office shall:

. Index an initial financing statement according to the name of the debtor and index all filed records relating to the initial financing statement in a manner that associates with one another an initial financing statement and all filed records relating to the initial financing statement; and

. Index a record that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates also according to the name that was not previously provided.

.. Indexing: Real-property-related financing statement. If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, it must be filed for record and the filing office shall index it:

. Under the names of the debtor and of each owner of record shown on the financing statement as if they were the mortgagors under a mortgage of the real property described; and

. To the extent that the law of this state provides for indexing of records of mortgages under the name of the mortgagee, under the name of the secured party as if the secured party were the mortgagee thereunder, or, if indexing is by description, as if the financing statement were a record of a mortgage of the real property described.

.. Indexing: Real-property-related assignment. If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(a) or an amendment filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(b):

. Under the name of the assignor as grantor; and

. To the extent that the law of this state provides for indexing a record of the assignment of a mortgage under the name of the assignee, under the name of the assignee.

.. Retrieval and association capability. The filing office shall maintain a capability:

. To retrieve a record by the name of the debtor and by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and

. To associate and retrieve with one another an initial financing statement and each filed record relating to the initial financing statement.

.. Removal of debtor's name. The filing office may not remove a debtor's name from the index until one year after the effectiveness of a financing statement naming the debtor lapses under RCW 62A.9A-515 with respect to all secured parties of record.

.. Timeliness of filing office performance. The filing office shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (e) of this section at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule, but not later than two business days after the filing office receives the record in question.

.. Inapplicability to real-property-related filing office. Subsections (b) and (h) of this section do not apply to a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1).

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-519; ]

== 62A.9A-520 - Acceptance and refusal to accept record.
.. Mandatory refusal to accept record. The filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(2) shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in RCW 62A.9A-516(b). A filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1) shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in RCW 62A.9A-516(b) (1) through (4) and any filing office may refuse to accept a record for filing only for a reason set forth in RCW 62A.9A-516(b).

.. Communication concerning refusal. If a filing office refuses to accept a record for filing, it shall communicate to the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule but, in the case of a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(2), in no event more than two business days after the filing office receives the record.

.. When filed financing statement effective. A filed financing statement satisfying RCW 62A.9A-502 (a) and (b) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (a) of this section. However, RCW 62A.9A-338 applies to a filed financing statement providing information described in RCW 62A.9A-516(b)(5) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed.

.. Separate application to multiple debtors. If a record communicated to a filing office provides information that relates to more than one debtor, this part applies as to each debtor separately.

== 62A.9A-522 - Maintenance and destruction of records.
.. Post-lapse maintenance and retrieval of information. The filing office shall maintain a record of the information provided in a filed financing statement for at least one year after the effectiveness of the financing statement has lapsed under RCW 62A.9A-515 with respect to all secured parties of record. The record must be retrievable by using the name of the debtor and by using the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates.

.. Destruction of written records. Except to the extent that a statute governing disposition of public records provides otherwise, the filing office immediately may destroy any written record evidencing a financing statement. However, if the filing office destroys a written record, it shall maintain another record of the financing statement which complies with subsection (a) of this section.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-522; ]

== 62A.9A-523 - Information from filing office; sale or license of records.
.. Acknowledgment of filing written record. If a person that files a written record requests an acknowledgment of the filing, the filing office shall send to the person an image of the record showing the number assigned to the record pursuant to RCW 62A.9A-519(a)(1) and the date and time of the filing of the record. However, if the person furnishes a copy of the record to the filing office, the filing office may instead:

. Note upon the copy the number assigned to the record pursuant to RCW 62A.9A-519(a)(1) and the date and time of the filing of the record; and

. Send the copy to the person.

.. Acknowledgment of filing other record. If a person files a record other than a written record, the filing office shall communicate to the person an acknowledgment that provides:

. The information in the record;

. The number assigned to the record pursuant to RCW 62A.9A-519(a)(1); and

. The date and time of the filing of the record.

.. Communication of requested information. The filing office shall communicate or otherwise make available in a record the following information to any person that requests it:

. Whether there is on file on a date and time specified by the filing office, but not a date earlier than three business days before the filing office receives the request, any financing statement that:

(A) Designates a particular debtor or, if the request so states, designates a particular debtor at the address specified in the request;

(B) Has not lapsed under RCW 62A.9A-515 with respect to all secured parties of record; and

(C) If the request so states, has lapsed under RCW 62A.9A-515 and a record of which is maintained by the filing office under RCW 62A.9A-522(a);

. The date and time of filing of each financing statement; and

. The information provided in each financing statement.

.. Medium for communicating information. In complying with its duty under subsection (c) of this section, the filing office may communicate information in any medium. However, if requested, the filing office shall communicate information by issuing a record that can be admitted into evidence in the courts of this state without extrinsic evidence of its authenticity.

.. Timeliness of filing office performance. The filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(2) shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (d) of this section at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule, but not later than two business days after the filing office receives the request.

.. Public availability of records. At least weekly, the filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(2) shall offer to sell or license to the public on a nonexclusive basis, in bulk, copies of all records filed in it under this part, in every medium from time to time available to the filing office. If information provided pursuant to this section includes a list of individuals, disclosure of the list is specifically authorized.

== 62A.9A-524 - Delay by filing office.
Delay by the filing office beyond a time limit prescribed by this part is excused if:

. The delay is caused by interruption of communication or computer facilities, war, emergency conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances beyond control of the filing office; and

. The filing office exercises reasonable diligence under the circumstances.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-524; ]

== 62A.9A-525 - Fees.
.. Filing with department of licensing. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) or (e) of this section, the fee for filing and indexing a record under this part is the fee set by department of licensing rule pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Without limitation, different fees may be charged for:

. A record that is communicated in writing and consists of one or two pages;

. A record that is communicated in writing and consists of more than two pages, which fee may be a multiple of the fee described in (1) of this subsection; and

. A record that is communicated by another medium authorized by department of licensing rule, which fee may be a fraction of the fee described in (1) of this subsection.

.. Filing with other filing offices. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, the fee for filing and indexing a record under this part that is filed in a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1) is the fee that would otherwise be applicable to the recording of a mortgage in that filing office, as set forth in RCW 36.18.010.

.. Number of names. The number of names required to be indexed does not affect the amount of the fee in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

.. Response to information request. The fee for responding to a request for information from a filing office, including for issuing a certificate showing, or otherwise communicating, whether there is on file any financing statement naming a particular debtor, is the fee set by department of licensing rule pursuant to subsection (f) of this section; provided however, if the request is to a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1) and that office charges a different fee, then that different fee shall apply instead. Without limitation, different fees may be charged:

. If the request is communicated in writing;

. If the request is communicated by another medium authorized by filing-office rule; and

. If the request is for expedited service.

.. Record of mortgage. This section does not require a fee with respect to a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut under RCW 62A.9A-502(c). However, the recording and satisfaction fees that otherwise would be applicable to the record of the mortgage apply.

.. Filing office rules. (1) The department of licensing shall by rule set the fees called for in this section for filing with, and obtaining information from, the department of licensing. The director shall set fees at a sufficient level to defray the costs of administering the program. All receipts from fees collected under this title, except fees for services covered under RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1), shall be deposited to the uniform commercial code fund in the state treasury. Moneys in the fund may be spent only after appropriation and may be used only to administer the uniform commercial code program.

. Until July 1, 2030, in addition to fees on filings authorized under this section, the department of licensing shall impose a surcharge of fifteen dollars per filing for paper filings and a surcharge of fifteen dollars per filing for electronic filings. The department shall deposit the proceeds from these surcharges in the financial fraud and identity theft crimes investigation and prosecution account created in RCW 43.330.300.

.. Transition. This section continues the fee-setting authority conferred on the department of licensing by former *RCW 62A.9-409 and nothing herein shall invalidate fees set by the department of licensing under the authority of former *RCW 62A.9-409.

The department of licensing shall report annually on or before December 31st to the governor on the operation of the filing office.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-527; ]

== 62A.9A-601 - Rights after default; judicial enforcement; consignor or buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes.
.. Rights of secured party after default. After default, a secured party has the rights provided in this part and, except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-602, those provided by agreement of the parties. A secured party:

. May reduce a claim to judgment, foreclose, or otherwise enforce the claim, security interest, or agricultural lien by any available judicial procedure; and

.. Rights and duties of secured party in possession or control. A secured party in possession of collateral or control of collateral under RCW 62A.7-106, 62A.9A-104, 62A.9A-105, 62A.9A-106, or 62A.9A-107 has the rights and duties provided in RCW 62A.9A-207.

.. Lien of levy after judgment. If a secured party has reduced its claim to judgment, the lien of any levy that may be made upon the collateral by virtue of an execution based upon the judgment relates back to the earliest of:

. The date of perfection of the security interest or agricultural lien in the collateral;

. The date of filing a financing statement covering the collateral; or

. Any date specified in a statute under which the agricultural lien was created.

.. Execution sale. A sale pursuant to an execution is a foreclosure of the security interest or agricultural lien by judicial procedure within the meaning of this section. A secured party may purchase at the sale and thereafter hold the collateral free of any other requirements of this Article.

.. Consignor or buyer of certain rights to payment. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-607(c), this part imposes no duties upon a secured party that is a consignor or is a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes.

.. Enforcement restrictions. All rights and remedies provided in this part with respect to promissory notes or an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or a general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise, are subject to RCW 62A.9A-408 to the extent applicable.

== 62A.9A-602 - Waiver and variance of rights and duties.
Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-624, to the extent that they give rights to an obligor (other than a secondary obligor) or a debtor and impose duties on a secured party, the debtor or obligor may not waive or vary the rules stated in the following listed sections:

== 62A.9A-603 - Agreement on standards concerning rights and duties.
.. Agreed standards. The parties may determine by agreement the standards measuring the fulfillment of the rights of a debtor or obligor and the duties of a secured party under a rule stated in RCW 62A.9A-602 if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.

.. Agreed standards inapplicable to breach of peace. Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to the duty under RCW 62A.9A-609 to refrain from breaching the peace.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-603; ]

== 62A.9A-604 - Procedure if security agreement covers real property, fixtures, or manufactured home.
.. Enforcement: Personal and real property. If a security agreement covers both personal and real property, a secured party may proceed:

. Under this part as to the personal property without prejudicing any rights with respect to the real property; or

. As to both the personal property and the real property in accordance with the rights with respect to the real property, in which case the other provisions of this part do not apply.

.. Enforcement: Fixtures. Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a security agreement covers goods that are or become fixtures, a secured party may proceed:

. Under this part; or

. In accordance with the rights with respect to real property, in which case the other provisions of this part do not apply.

.. Removal of fixtures or manufactured home. Subject to the other provisions of this part, if a secured party holding a security interest in fixtures or a manufactured home has priority over all owners and encumbrancers of the real property, the secured party, after default, may remove the collateral from the real property.

.. Injury caused by removal. A secured party that removes collateral consisting of fixtures or a manufactured home shall promptly reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real property, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury caused by the removal. The secured party need not reimburse the encumbrancer or owner for any diminution in value of the real property caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-604; ]

== 62A.9A-605 - Unknown debtor or secondary obligor.
A secured party does not owe a duty based on its status as secured party:

. To a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows:

(A) That the person is a debtor or obligor;

(B) The identity of the person; and

(C) How to communicate with the person; or

. To a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against a person, unless the secured party knows:

(A) That the person is a debtor; and

(B) The identity of the person.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-605; ]

== 62A.9A-606 - Time of default for agricultural lien.
For purposes of this part, a default occurs in connection with an agricultural lien at the time the secured party becomes entitled to enforce the lien in accordance with the statute under which it was created.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-606; ]

== 62A.9A-607 - Collection and enforcement by secured party.
.. Collection and enforcement generally. If so agreed, and in any event after default, a secured party:

. May notify an account debtor or other person obligated on collateral to make payment or otherwise render performance to or for the benefit of the secured party;

. May take any proceeds to which the secured party is entitled under RCW 62A.9A-315;

. May enforce the obligations of an account debtor or other person obligated on collateral and exercise the rights of the debtor with respect to the obligation of the account debtor or other person obligated on collateral to make payment or otherwise render performance to the debtor, and with respect to any property that secures the obligations of the account debtor or other person obligated on the collateral;

. If it holds a security interest in a deposit account perfected by control under RCW 62A.9A-104(a)(1), may apply the balance of the deposit account to the obligation secured by the deposit account; and

. If it holds a security interest in a deposit account perfected by control under RCW 62A.9A-104(a) (2) or (3), may instruct the bank to pay the balance of the deposit account to or for the benefit of the secured party.

.. Nonjudicial enforcement of mortgage.

Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under subsection (a)(3) of this section.

.. Application of noncash proceeds. A secured party need not apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of disposition under RCW 62A.9A-610 unless the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable. A secured party that applies or pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable manner.

.. Surplus or deficiency if obligation secured. If the security interest under which a disposition is made secures payment or performance of an obligation, after making the payments and applications required by subsection (a) of this section and permitted by subsection (c) of this section:

. Is subrogated to the rights of a secured party with respect to collateral.

.. Effect of assignment, transfer, or subrogation. An assignment, transfer, or subrogation described in subsection (a) of this section:

.. Effect of transfer statement. A transfer statement entitles the transferee to the transfer of record of all rights of the debtor in the collateral specified in the statement in any official filing, recording, registration, or certificate-of-title system covering the collateral. If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall:

. Accept the transfer statement;

. Promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer; and

. If applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee.

.. Transfer not a disposition; no relief of secured party's duties. A transfer of the record or legal title to collateral to a secured party under subsection (b) of this section or otherwise is not of itself a disposition of collateral under this Article and does not of itself relieve the secured party of its duties under this Article.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-624; ]

== 62A.9A-625 - Remedies for secured party's failure to comply with Article.
.. Judicial orders concerning noncompliance. If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this Article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.

.. Damages for noncompliance. Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (f) of this section, a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this Article or by filing a false statement under RCW 62A.9A-607(b) or 62A.9A-619. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.

.. Persons entitled to recover damages; statutory damages in consumer-goods transaction. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-628:

. A person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) of this section for its loss; and

. If the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus ten percent of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential plus ten percent of the cash price.

.. Recovery when deficiency eliminated or reduced. A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under RCW 62A.9A-626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor may not recover under subsection (b) or (c)(2) of this section for noncompliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance to the extent that its deficiency is eliminated or reduced under RCW 62A.9A-626.

.. Statutory damages: Noncompliance with specified provisions. In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection (b) of this section, the debtor, consumer obligor, or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may recover five hundred dollars in each case from a person that:

. Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-208;

. Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-209;

. Files a record that the person is not entitled to file under RCW 62A.9A-509(a);

. Fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by RCW 62A.9A-513 (a) or (c) within twenty days after the secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor;

. Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-616(b)(1) and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance; or

. Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-616(b)(2).

.. Statutory damages: Noncompliance with RCW 62A.9A-210. A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under subsection (b) of this section and, in addition, five hundred dollars in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under RCW 62A.9A-210. A recipient of a request under RCW 62A.9A-210 which never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under RCW 62A.9A-210 has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.

.. Limitation of security interest: Noncompliance with RCW 62A.9A-210. If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under RCW 62A.9A-210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure.

== 62A.9A-626 - Action in which deficiency or surplus is in issue.
.. Applicable rules if amount of deficiency or surplus in issue. In an action arising from a transaction in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:

. A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue.

. If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this part.

. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorneys' fees exceeds the greater of:

(A) The proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance; or

(B) The amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance.

. For purposes of (3)(B) of this subsection, the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorneys' fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum.

.. [Reserved]

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-626; ]

== 62A.9A-627 - Determination of whether conduct was commercially reasonable.
.. Greater amount obtainable under other circumstances; no preclusion of commercial reasonableness. The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.

.. Dispositions that are commercially reasonable. A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:

. In the usual manner on any recognized market;

. At the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or

. Otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.

.. Approval by court or on behalf of creditors. A collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:

. In a judicial proceeding;

. By a bona fide creditors' committee;

. By a representative of creditors; or

. By an assignee for the benefit of creditors.

.. Approval under subsection (c) of this section not necessary; absence of approval has no effect. Approval under subsection (c) of this section need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is not commercially reasonable.

[ 2000 c 250 § 9A-627; ]

== 62A.9A-628 - Nonliability and limitation on liability of secured party; liability of secondary obligor.
.. Limitation of liability of secured party for noncompliance with article. Unless a secured party knows that a person is a debtor or obligor, knows the identity of the person, and knows how to communicate with the person:

. The secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this Article; and

. The secured party's failure to comply with this Article does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency.

.. Limitation of liability based on status as secured party. A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party:

. To a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows:

(A) That the person is a debtor or obligor;

(B) The identity of the person; and

(C) How to communicate with the person; or

. To a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against a person, unless the secured party knows:

(A) That the person is a debtor; and

(B) The identity of the person.

.. Limitation of liability if reasonable belief that transaction not a consumer-goods transaction or consumer transaction. A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party's reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer-goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on:

. A debtor's representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired, or held; or

. An obligor's representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred.

.. Limitation of liability for statutory damages. A secured party is not liable to any person under RCW 62A.9A-625(c)(2) for its failure to comply with RCW 62A.9A-616.

.. Limitation of multiple liability for statutory damages. A secured party is not liable under RCW 62A.9A-625(c)(2) more than once with respect to any one secured obligation.

== 62A.9A-703 - Security interest perfected before effective date.
.. Continuing priority over lien creditor: Perfection requirements satisfied. A security interest that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2001, and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time is a perfected security interest under Article 62A.9A RCW if, on or before July 1, 2001, the applicable requirements for enforceability and perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW are satisfied without further action.

.. Continuing priority over lien creditor: Perfection requirements not satisfied. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-705, if, immediately before July 1, 2001, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW are not satisfied on or before July 1, 2001, the security interest:

. Is a perfected security interest for one year after July 1, 2001;

. Remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest becomes enforceable under RCW 62A.9A-203 before the year expires; and

. Remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW are satisfied before the year expires.

== 62A.9A-704 - Security interest unperfected before effective date.
A security interest that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2001, but which would be subordinate to the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time:

. Remains an enforceable security interest for one year after July 1, 2001;

. Remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes enforceable under RCW 62A.9A-203 on or before July 1, 2001, or within one year thereafter; and

. Becomes perfected:

(A) Without further action, on July 1, 2001, if the applicable requirements for perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW are satisfied before or at that time; or

(B) When the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time.

== 62A.9A-705 - Effectiveness of action taken before effective date.
.. Preeffective-date action; one-year perfection period unless reperfected. If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before July 1, 2001, and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before July 1, 2001, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under Article 62A.9A RCW within one year after July 1, 2001. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after July 1, 2001, unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under Article 62A.9A RCW before the expiration of that period.

.. Preeffective-date filing. The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2001, is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW.

.. Preeffective-date filing in jurisdiction formerly governing perfection. Article 62A.9A RCW does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July 1, 2001, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former *RCW 62A.9-103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and RCW 62A.9A-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:

. The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or

. June 30, 2006.

.. Continuation statement. The filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001, does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before July 1, 2001. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001, and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before July 1, 2001, continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.

.. Application of subsection (c)(2) of this section to transmitting utility financing statement. Subsection (c)(2) of this section applies to a financing statement that, before July 1, 2001, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former *RCW 62A.9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.

.. Application of Part 5. A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001, and a continuation statement filed after July 1, 2001, is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement.

[ http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5053.SL.pdf?cite=2001%20c%2032%20§%2049[2001 c 32 § 49]; 2000 c 250 § 9A-705; ]

== 62A.9A-706 - When initial financing statement suffices to continue effectiveness of financing statement.
.. Initial financing statement in lieu of continuation statement. The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in RCW 62A.9A-501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001, if:

. The filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under Article 62A.9A RCW;

. The preeffective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another state or another office in this state; and

. The initial financing statement satisfies subsection (c) of this section.

.. Period of continued effectiveness. The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (a) of this section continues the effectiveness of the preeffective-date financing statement:

. If the initial financing statement is filed before July 1, 2001, for the period provided in *RCW 62A.9-403 with respect to a financing statement; and

. If the initial financing statement is filed after July 1, 2001, for the period provided in RCW 62A.9A-515 with respect to an initial financing statement.

.. Requirements for initial financing statement under subsection (a) of this section. To be effective for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, an initial financing statement must:

. Satisfy the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement;

. Identify the preeffective-date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and

. Indicate that the preeffective-date financing statement remains effective.

== 62A.9A-707 - Amendment of preeffective-date financing statement.
.. Preeffective-date financing statement. In this section, "preeffective-date financing statement" means a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001.

.. Applicable law. On or after July 1, 2001, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a preeffective-date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3. However, the effectiveness of a preeffective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed.

.. Method of amending: General rule. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, if the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a preeffective-date financing statement may be amended on or after July 1, 2001, only if:

. The preeffective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in RCW 62A.9A-501;

. An amendment is filed in the office specified in RCW 62A.9A-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies RCW 62A.9A-706(c); or

. An initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies RCW 62A.9A-706(c) is filed in the office specified in RCW 62A.9A-501.

.. Method of amending: Continuation. If the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a preeffective-date financing statement may be continued only under RCW 62A.9A-705 (d) and (f) or 62A.9A-706.

.. Method of amending: Additional termination rule. Whether or not the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a preeffective-date financing statement filed in this state may be terminated on or after July 1, 2001, by filing a termination statement in the office in which the preeffective-date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies RCW 62A.9A-706(c) has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3 as the office in which to file a financing statement.

A person may file an initial financing statement or a continuation statement under this part if:

. The secured party of record authorizes the filing; and

. The filing is necessary under this part:

(A) To continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001; or

(B) To perfect or continue the perfection of a security interest.

== 62A.9A-709 - Priority.
.. Law governing priority. Article 62A.9A RCW determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral. However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before July 1, 2001, *Article 62A.9 RCW determines priority.

.. Priority if security interest becomes enforceable under RCW 62A.9A-203. For purposes of RCW 62A.9A-322(a), the priority of a security interest that becomes enforceable under RCW 62A.9A-203 dates from July 1, 2001, if the security interest is perfected under Article 62A.9A RCW by the filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2001, which would not have been effective to perfect the security interest under *Article 62A.9 RCW. This subsection does not apply to conflicting security interests each of which is perfected by the filing of such a financing statement.

== 62A.9A-805 - Effectiveness of action taken before effective date.
.. Preeffective date filing effective. The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2013, is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under chapter 62A.9A RCW as of July 1, 2013.

.. When preeffective date filing becomes ineffective. Chapter 74, Laws of 2011 does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July 1, 2013, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in chapter 62A.9A RCW as it existed before July 1, 2013. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section and RCW 62A.9A-806, the financing statement ceases to be effective:

. If the financing statement is filed in this state, at the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective had this section not taken effect; or

. If the financing statement is filed in another jurisdiction, at the earlier of:

(A) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of that jurisdiction; or

(B) June 30, 2018.

Subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section applies to a financing statement that, before July 1, 2013, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in chapter 62A.9A RCW as it existed before July 1, 2013, only to the extent that chapter 62A.9A RCW as of July 1, 2013, provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.

.. Application of Part 4.
