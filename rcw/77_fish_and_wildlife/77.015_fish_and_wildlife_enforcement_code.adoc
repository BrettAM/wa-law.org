= 77.15 - Fish and wildlife enforcement code.
:toc:

== 77.15.005 - Finding—Intent.
The legislature finds that merger of the departments of fisheries and wildlife resulted in two criminal codes applicable to fish and wildlife, and that it has become increasingly difficult to administer and enforce the two criminal codes. Furthermore, laws defining crimes involving fish and wildlife have evolved over many years of changing uses and management objectives for fish and wildlife. The resulting two codes make it difficult for citizens to comply with the law and unnecessarily complicate enforcement of laws against violators.

The legislature intends by chapter 190, Laws of 1998 to revise and recodify the criminal laws governing fish and wildlife, ensuring that all people involved with fish and wildlife are able to know and understand the requirements of the laws and the risks of violation. Additionally, the legislature intends to create a more uniform approach to criminal laws governing fish and wildlife and to the laws authorizing prosecution, sentencing, and punishments, including repealing crimes that are redundant to other provisions of the criminal code.

Chapter 190, Laws of 1998 is not intended to alter existing powers of the commission or the director to adopt rules or exercise powers over fish and wildlife. In some places reference is made to violation of department rules, but this is intended to conform with current powers of the commission, director, or both, to adopt rules governing fish and wildlife activities.

== 77.15.070 - Civil forfeiture of property used for violation of chapter.
. Fish and wildlife officers and ex officio fish and wildlife officers may seize without warrant boats, airplanes, vehicles, motorized implements, conveyances, gear, appliances, or other articles they have probable cause to believe have been held with intent to violate or used in violation of this title or rule of the commission or director. However, fish and wildlife officers or ex officio fish and wildlife officers may not seize any item or article, other than for evidence, if under the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the violation was inadvertent. The property seized is subject to forfeiture to the state under this section regardless of ownership. Property seized may be recovered by its owner by depositing with the department or into court a cash bond or equivalent security equal to the value of the seized property but not more than one hundred thousand dollars. Such cash bond or security is subject to forfeiture in lieu of the property. Forfeiture of property seized under this section is a civil forfeiture against property and is intended to be a remedial civil sanction.

. In the event of a seizure of property under this section, jurisdiction to begin the forfeiture proceedings shall commence upon seizure. Within fifteen days following the seizure, the seizing authority shall serve a written notice of intent to forfeit property on the owner of the property seized and on any person having any known right or interest in the property seized. Notice may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule, including service by certified mail with return receipt requested. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the fifteen-day period following the seizure.

. Persons claiming a right of ownership or right to possession of property are entitled to a hearing to contest forfeiture. Such a claim shall specify the claim of ownership or possession and shall be made in writing and served on the director within forty-five days of the seizure. If the seizing authority has complied with notice requirements and there is no claim made within forty-five days, then the property shall be forfeited to the state.

. If any person timely serves the director with a claim to property, the person shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard as to the person's claim or right. The hearing shall be before the director or director's designee, or before an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW, except that a person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction if the aggregate value of the property seized is more than five thousand dollars. The department may settle a person's claim of ownership prior to the administrative hearing.

. The hearing to contest forfeiture and any subsequent appeal shall be as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act. The seizing authority has the burden to demonstrate that it had reason to believe the property was held with intent to violate or was used in violation of this title or rule of the commission or director. The person contesting forfeiture has the burden of production and proof by a preponderance of evidence that the person owns or has a right to possess the property and:

.. That the property was not held with intent to violate or used in violation of this title; or

.. If the property is a boat, airplane, or vehicle, that the illegal use or planned illegal use of the boat, airplane, or vehicle occurred without the owner's knowledge or consent, and that the owner acted reasonably to prevent illegal uses of such boat, airplane, or vehicle.

. A forfeiture of a conveyance encumbered by a perfected security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission. No security interest in seized property may be perfected after seizure.

. If seized property is forfeited under this section the department may retain it for official use unless the property is required to be destroyed, or upon application by any law enforcement agency of the state, release such property to the agency for the use of enforcing this title, or sell such property, and deposit the proceeds to the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account created in RCW 77.15.425.

. Any liability or claim of liability under chapter 4.92 RCW that arises out of the exercise or alleged exercise of authority by a fish and wildlife officer rests with the department unless the fish and wildlife officer acts under the direction and control of another agency or unless the liability is otherwise assumed under an agreement between the department and another agency.

== 77.15.100 - Seized fish, shellfish, wildlife, and covered animal species part or product—Forfeiture—Sale—Disposition of sale.
. Fish, shellfish, and wildlife are property of the state under RCW 77.04.012. Fish and wildlife officers may sell seized, commercially taken or possessed fish and shellfish to a wholesale buyer and deposit the proceeds into the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account under RCW 77.15.425. Seized, recreationally taken or possessed fish, shellfish, and wildlife may be donated to nonprofit charitable organizations. The charitable organization must qualify for tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(3) of the federal internal revenue code. Seized fish, shellfish, and wildlife may be returned to the environment or otherwise safely disposed of if storage is not practical under the circumstances, after the evidentiary value of the seized fish, shellfish, or wildlife has been preserved through photographs, measurements, biological samples, or other reasonable means. If an exculpatory value is clearly apparent in the seized fish, shellfish, or wildlife, and the exculpatory value is not otherwise reasonably obtainable, the fish, shellfish, or wildlife should be retained.

. Fish and wildlife officers may dispose of any covered animal species part or product seized through the enforcement of RCW 77.15.135 through a donation to a bona fide educational or scientific institution, solely for the purposes of raising awareness of the trafficking and threatened nature of endangered animals, as allowed under state, federal, and international law.

. Unless otherwise provided in this title, fish, shellfish, wildlife, or any covered animal species part or product taken or possessed in violation of this title or department rule shall be forfeited to the state upon:

.. Conviction as defined in RCW 77.15.050;

.. A finding of guilt or plea of guilty pursuant to an amended information for any violation that was originally charged as a violation of this title or department rule regardless of whether the imposition of sentence is deferred or the penalty is suspended;

.. Any infraction adjudicated under this title, department rule, or chapter 7.84 RCW with a final disposition of committed, paid, or uncontested, regardless of whether the violation was originally charged as a criminal offense and regardless of whether the penalty is suspended or deferred; or

.. Any disposition of a case arising from an act originally charged as a violation of this title or department rule, or an infraction cited or referred as a violation of this title, department rule, or chapter 7.84 RCW, whereby the offender enters into a disposition that continues or defers the case for dismissal upon the successful completion of specific terms or conditions. For cases resulting in other types of dispositions that are not defined in RCW 77.15.050, including findings of not guilty, not committed, or dismissal with prejudice due to a failure of proof or violation of law, the fish, shellfish, wildlife, or covered animal species part or product may be returned, or its equivalent value paid, if the fish, shellfish, wildlife, or covered animal species part or product have already been donated or sold. If a case is dismissed without prejudice and is subject to being refiled, the seized fish, shellfish, wildlife, or covered animal species part or product need not be returned until the statute of limitations for the violation has expired. Nothing in this section prevents the seizing authority from pursuing forfeiture under RCW 77.15.070 or any other statute or rule.

The value assigned to specific fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife by RCW 77.15.420 may be presumed to be the value of such fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife. It is not relevant to proof of value that the person charged misrepresented that the fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife was taken in compliance with law if the fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife was unlawfully taken and had no lawful market value.
