== 71.24.015 - Legislative intent—Community behavioral health system.
It is the intent of the legislature to establish a community behavioral health system which shall help people experiencing mental illness or a substance use disorder to retain a respected and productive position in the community. This will be accomplished through programs that focus on resilience and recovery, and practices that are evidence-based, research-based, consensus-based, or, where these do not exist, promising or emerging best practices, which provide for:

. Access to behavioral health services for adults with mental illness and children with mental illness, emotional disturbances, or substance use disorders, that recognize the special needs of underserved populations, including minorities, children, older adults, individuals with disabilities, and low-income persons. Access to mental health and substance use disorder services shall not be limited by a person's history of confinement in a state, federal, or local correctional facility. It is also the purpose of this chapter to promote the early identification of children with mental illness and to ensure that they receive the mental health care and treatment which is appropriate to their developmental level. This care should improve home, school, and community functioning, maintain children in a safe and nurturing home environment, and should enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment while also recognizing parents' rights to participate in treatment decisions for their children;

. The involvement of persons with mental illness or substance use disorder, their family members, and advocates in designing and implementing behavioral health services that reduce unnecessary hospitalization and incarceration and promote recovery and employment. To improve the quality of services available and promote the rehabilitation, recovery, and reintegration of persons with mental illness or substance use disorder, consumer and advocate participation in behavioral health services is an integral part of the community behavioral health system and shall be supported;

. Accountability of efficient and effective services through state-of-the-art outcome and performance measures and statewide standards for monitoring client and system outcomes, performance, and reporting of client and system outcome information. These processes shall be designed so as to maximize the use of available resources for direct care of people with a mental illness and to assure uniform data collection across the state;

. Minimum service delivery standards;

. Priorities for the use of available resources for the care of individuals with mental illness or substance use disorder consistent with the priorities defined in the statute;

. Coordination of services within the department of social and health services, the authority, the department, the department of children, youth, and families, and the office of the superintendent of public instruction, and among state mental hospitals, tribes, residential treatment facilities, county authorities, behavioral health administrative services organizations, managed care organizations, community behavioral health services, and other support services, which shall to the maximum extent feasible also include the families of individuals with mental illness or substance use disorder, and other service providers, including Indian health care providers; and

. Coordination of services aimed at reducing duplication in service delivery and promoting complementary services among all entities that provide behavioral health services to adults and children.

It is the policy of the state to encourage the provision of a full range of treatment and rehabilitation services in the state for mental disorders, or substance use disorders, including services operated by consumers and advocates. The legislature intends to encourage the development of regional behavioral health services with adequate local flexibility to assure eligible people in need of care access to the least-restrictive treatment alternative appropriate to their needs, and the availability of treatment components to assure continuity of care. The legislature hereby finds and declares that sound fiscal management requires vigilance to ensure that funds appropriated by the legislature for the provision of needed community behavioral health system services are ultimately expended solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated, and not for any other purpose.

It is further the intent of the legislature to integrate the provision of services to provide continuity of care through all phases of treatment. To this end, the legislature intends to promote active engagement with persons with mental illness and collaboration between families and service providers.

. The legislature intends that eastern and western state hospitals shall operate as clinical centers for handling the most complicated long-term care needs of patients with a primary diagnosis of mental disorder.

The legislature further intends to explicitly hold behavioral health administrative services organizations, within available resources, and managed care organizations accountable for serving people with mental disorders within the boundaries of their regional service area.

. The authority shall establish a work group to determine: (a) How to appropriately manage access to adult long-term inpatient involuntary care and the children's long-term inpatient program in the community and at eastern and western state hospitals, until such a time as the risk for long-term involuntary inpatient care may be fully integrated into managed care organization contracts, and provide advice to guide the integration process; and (b) how to expand bidirectional integration through increased support for co-occurring disorder services, including recommendations related to purchasing and rates. The work group shall include representation from the department of social and health services, the department of health, behavioral health administrative services organizations, at least two managed care organizations, the Washington state association of counties, community behavioral health providers, including providers with experience providing co-occurring disorder services, and the Washington state hospital association. Managed care representation on the work group must include at least one member with financial expertise and at least one member with clinical expertise. The managed care organizations on the work group shall represent the entire managed care sector and shall collaborate with the nonrepresented managed care organizations. The work group shall provide recommendations to the office of financial management and appropriate committees of the legislature by December 15, 2019.

. The secretary shall establish by rule minimum standards for licensed or certified behavioral health agencies that must, at a minimum, establish: (a) Qualifications for staff providing services directly to persons with mental disorders, substance use disorders, or both; (b) the intended result of each service; and (c) the rights and responsibilities of persons receiving behavioral health services pursuant to this chapter and chapter 71.05 RCW. The secretary shall provide for deeming of licensed or certified behavioral health agencies as meeting state minimum standards as a result of accreditation by a recognized behavioral health accrediting body recognized and having a current agreement with the department.

. The department shall review reports or other information alleging a failure to comply with this chapter or the standards and rules adopted under this chapter and may initiate investigations and enforcement actions based on those reports.

. The department shall conduct inspections of agencies and facilities, including reviews of records and documents required to be maintained under this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter.

. The department may suspend, revoke, limit, restrict, or modify an approval, or refuse to grant approval, for failure to meet the provisions of this chapter, or the standards adopted under this chapter. RCW 43.70.115 governs notice of a license or certification denial, revocation, suspension, or modification and provides the right to an adjudicative proceeding.

. No licensed or certified behavioral health service provider may advertise or represent itself as a licensed or certified behavioral health service provider if approval has not been granted or has been denied, suspended, revoked, or canceled.

. Licensure or certification as a behavioral health service provider is effective for one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license or certification. The license or certification must specify the types of services provided by the behavioral health service provider that meet the standards adopted under this chapter. Renewal of a license or certification must be made in accordance with this section for initial approval and in accordance with the standards set forth in rules adopted by the secretary.

. Licensure or certification as a licensed or certified behavioral health service provider must specify the types of services provided that meet the standards adopted under this chapter. Renewal of a license or certification must be made in accordance with this section for initial approval and in accordance with the standards set forth in rules adopted by the secretary.

. The department shall develop a process by which a provider may obtain dual licensure as an evaluation and treatment facility and secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility.

. Licensed or certified behavioral health service providers may not provide types of services for which the licensed or certified behavioral health service provider has not been certified. Licensed or certified behavioral health service providers may provide services for which approval has been sought and is pending, if approval for the services has not been previously revoked or denied.

. The department periodically shall inspect licensed or certified behavioral health service providers at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

. Upon petition of the department and after a hearing held upon reasonable notice to the facility, the superior court may issue a warrant to an officer or employee of the department authorizing him or her to enter and inspect at reasonable times, and examine the books and accounts of, any licensed or certified behavioral health service provider refusing to consent to inspection or examination by the department or which the department has reasonable cause to believe is operating in violation of this chapter.

. The department shall maintain and periodically publish a current list of licensed or certified behavioral health service providers.

. Each licensed or certified behavioral health service provider shall file with the department or the authority upon request, data, statistics, schedules, and information the department or the authority reasonably requires. A licensed or certified behavioral health service provider that without good cause fails to furnish any data, statistics, schedules, or information as requested, or files fraudulent returns thereof, may have its license or certification revoked or suspended.

. The authority shall use the data provided in subsection (14) of this section to evaluate each program that admits children to inpatient substance use disorder treatment upon application of their parents. The evaluation must be done at least once every twelve months. In addition, the authority shall randomly select and review the information on individual children who are admitted on application of the child's parent for the purpose of determining whether the child was appropriately placed into substance use disorder treatment based on an objective evaluation of the child's condition and the outcome of the child's treatment.

. Any settlement agreement entered into between the department and licensed or certified behavioral health service providers to resolve administrative complaints, license or certification violations, license or certification suspensions, or license or certification revocations may not reduce the number of violations reported by the department unless the department concludes, based on evidence gathered by inspectors, that the licensed or certified behavioral health service provider did not commit one or more of the violations.

. In cases in which a behavioral health service provider that is in violation of licensing or certification standards attempts to transfer or sell the behavioral health service provider to a family member, the transfer or sale may only be made for the purpose of remedying license or certification violations and achieving full compliance with the terms of the license or certification.

Similarly, in order to terminate such contract, all counties that are contracted with the authority as a behavioral health administrative services organization must mutually agree to terminate the contract with the authority.

. Once the authority receives a request from a county or a group of counties within a regional service area to be the designated behavioral health administrative services organization, the authority must promptly collaborate with the county or group of counties within that regional service area to determine the most feasible implementation date and coordinate readiness reviews.

. No behavioral health administrative services organization may contract with itself as a behavioral health agency, or contract with a behavioral health agency that has administrative linkages to the behavioral health administrative services organization in any manner that would give the agency a competitive advantage in obtaining or competing for contracts, except that a county or group of counties may provide designated crisis responder services, initial crisis services, criminal diversion services, hospital reentry services, and criminal reentry services. The county-administered service must have a clear separation of powers and duties separate from a county-run behavioral health administrative services organization and suitable accounting procedures must be followed to ensure the funding is traceable and accounted for separately from other funds.

. Nothing in this section limits the authority's ability to take remedial actions up to and including termination of a contract in order to enforce contract terms or to remedy nonperformance of contractual duties.

The legislature finds that the current complex set of federal, state, and local rules and regulations, audited and administered at multiple levels, which affect the community mental health service delivery system, focus primarily on the process of providing mental health services and do not sufficiently address consumer and system outcomes. The legislature finds that the authority and the community mental health service delivery system must make ongoing efforts to achieve the purposes set forth in RCW 71.24.015 related to reduced administrative layering, duplication, elimination of process measures not specifically required by the federal government for the receipt of federal funds, and reduced administrative costs.

== 71.24.450 - Offenders with mental illnesses—Findings and intent.
. Many offenders with acute and chronic mental illness are delayed in their release from Washington correctional facilities due to their inability to access reasonable treatment and living accommodations prior to the maximum expiration of their sentences. Often the offender reaches the end of his or her sentence and is released without any follow-up care, funds, or housing. These delays are costly to the state, often lead to psychiatric relapse, and result in unnecessary risk to the public.

Many of these offenders lack the skills or emotional stability to maintain employment or even complete applications to receive entitlement funding. Housing and appropriate treatment are difficult to obtain.

This lack of resources, funding, treatment, and housing creates additional stress for the offender with mental illness, impairing self-control and judgment. When the mental illness is instrumental in the offender's patterns of crime, such stresses may lead to a worsening of his or her illness, reoffending, and a threat to public safety.

. It is the intent of the legislature to create a program to provide for postrelease mental health care and housing for a select group of offenders with mental illness entering community living, in order to reduce incarceration costs, increase public safety, and enhance the offender's quality of life.

== 71.24.455 - Offenders with mental illnesses—Contracts for specialized access and services.
. The director shall select and contract with a behavioral health administrative services organization, managed care organization, behavioral health agency, or private provider to provide specialized access and services to offenders with mental illness upon release from total confinement within the department of corrections who have been identified by the department of corrections and selected by the behavioral health administrative services organization, managed care organization, behavioral health agency, or private provider as high-priority clients for services and who meet service program entrance criteria. The program shall enroll no more than twenty-five offenders at any one time, or a number of offenders that can be accommodated within the appropriated funding level, and shall seek to fill any vacancies that occur.

. Criteria shall include a determination by department of corrections staff that:

.. The offender suffers from a major mental illness and needs continued mental health treatment;

.. The offender's previous crime or crimes have been determined by either the court or department of corrections staff to have been substantially influenced by the offender's mental illness;

.. It is believed the offender will be less likely to commit further criminal acts if provided ongoing mental health care;

.. The offender is unable or unlikely to obtain housing and/or treatment from other sources for any reason; and

.. The offender has at least one year remaining before his or her sentence expires but is within six months of release to community housing and is currently housed within a work release facility or any department of corrections' division of prisons facility.

. The behavioral health administrative services organization, managed care organization, behavioral health agency, or private provider shall provide specialized access and services to the selected offenders. The services shall be aimed at lowering the risk of recidivism. An oversight committee composed of a representative of the authority, a representative of the selected managed care organization, behavioral health administrative services organization, or private provider, and a representative of the department of corrections shall develop policies to guide the pilot program, provide dispute resolution including making determinations as to when entrance criteria or required services may be waived in individual cases, advise the department of corrections and the managed care organization, behavioral health administrative services organization, or private provider on the selection of eligible offenders, and set minimum requirements for service contracts. The selected managed care organization, behavioral health administrative services organization, or private provider shall implement the policies and service contracts. The following services shall be provided:

.. Intensive case management to include a full range of intensive community support and treatment in client-to-staff ratios of not more than ten offenders per case manager including: (i) A minimum of weekly group and weekly individual counseling; (ii) home visits by the program manager at least two times per month; and (iii) counseling focusing on maintaining and promoting ongoing stability, relapse prevention, and recovery.

.. The case manager shall attempt to locate and procure housing appropriate to the living and clinical needs of the offender and as needed to maintain the psychiatric stability of the offender. The entire range of emergency, transitional, and permanent housing and involuntary hospitalization must be considered as available housing options. A housing subsidy may be provided to offenders to defray housing costs up to a maximum of six thousand six hundred dollars per offender per year and be administered by the case manager. Additional funding sources may be used to offset these costs when available.

.. The case manager shall collaborate with the assigned prison, work release, or community corrections staff during release planning, prior to discharge, and in ongoing supervision of the offender while under the authority of the department of corrections.

.. Medications including the full range of psychotropic medications including atypical antipsychotic medications may be required as a condition of the program. Medication prescription, medication monitoring, and counseling to support offender understanding, acceptance, and compliance with prescribed medication regimens must be included.

.. A systematic effort to engage offenders to continuously involve themselves in current and long-term treatment and appropriate habilitative activities shall be made.

.. Classes appropriate to the clinical and living needs of the offender and appropriate to his or her level of understanding.

.. The case manager shall assist the offender in the application and qualification for entitlement funding, including medicaid, state assistance, and other available government and private assistance at any point that the offender is qualified and resources are available.

.. The offender shall be provided access to daily activities such as drop-in centers, prevocational and vocational training and jobs, and volunteer activities.

. Once an offender has been selected into the pilot program, the offender shall remain in the program until the end of his or her sentence or unless the offender is released from the pilot program earlier by the department of corrections.

. Specialized training in the management and supervision of high-crime risk offenders with mental illness shall be provided to all participating mental health providers by the authority and the department of corrections prior to their participation in the program and as requested thereafter.

== 71.24.480 - Offenders with mental illness who are believed to be dangerous—Limitation on liability due to treatment—Reporting requirements.
. A licensed or certified behavioral health agency acting in the course of the provider's duties under this chapter, is not liable for civil damages resulting from the injury or death of another caused by a participant in the offender reentry community safety program who is a client of the provider or organization, unless the act or omission of the provider or organization constitutes:

.. Gross negligence;

.. Willful or wanton misconduct; or

.. A breach of the duty to warn of and protect from a client's threatened violent behavior if the client has communicated a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably ascertainable victim or victims.

. In addition to any other requirements to report violations, the licensed or certified behavioral health agency shall report an offender's expressions of intent to harm or other predatory behavior, regardless of whether there is an ascertainable victim, in progress reports and other established processes that enable courts and supervising entities to assess and address the progress and appropriateness of treatment.

. A licensed or certified behavioral health agency's mere act of treating a participant in the offender reentry community safety program is not negligence. Nothing in this subsection alters the licensed or certified behavioral health agency's normal duty of care with regard to the client.

. The limited liability provided by this section applies only to the conduct of licensed or certified behavioral health agencies and does not apply to conduct of the state.

. For purposes of this section, "participant in the offender reentry community safety program" means a person who has been identified under RCW 72.09.370 as an offender who: (a) Is reasonably believed to be dangerous to himself or herself or others; and (b) has a mental disorder.

== 71.24.585 - Opioid and substance use disorder treatment—State response.
. [Empty]
.. The state of Washington declares that substance use disorders are medical conditions. Substance use disorders should be treated in a manner similar to other medical conditions by using interventions that are supported by evidence, including medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. It is also recognized that many individuals have multiple substance use disorders, as well as histories of trauma, developmental disabilities, or mental health conditions. As such, all individuals experiencing opioid use disorder should be offered evidence-supported treatments to include federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders and behavioral counseling and social supports to address them. For behavioral health agencies, an effective plan of treatment for most persons with opioid use disorder integrates access to medications and psychosocial counseling and should be consistent with the American society of addiction medicine patient placement criteria. Providers must inform patients with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder of options to access federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder or substance use disorder. Because some such medications are controlled substances in chapter 69.50 RCW, the state of Washington maintains the legal obligation and right to regulate the uses of these medications in the treatment of opioid use disorder.

.. The authority must work with other state agencies and stakeholders to develop value-based payment strategies to better support the ongoing care of persons with opioid and other substance use disorders.

.. The department of corrections shall develop policies to prioritize services based on available grant funding and funds appropriated specifically for opioid use disorder treatment.

. The authority must promote the use of medication therapies and other evidence-based strategies to address the opioid epidemic in Washington state. Additionally, by January 1, 2020, the authority must prioritize state resources for the provision of treatment and recovery support services to inpatient and outpatient treatment settings that allow patients to start or maintain their use of medications for opioid use disorder while engaging in services.

. The state declares that the main goals of treatment for persons with opioid use disorder are the cessation of unprescribed opioid use, reduced morbidity, and restoration of the ability to lead a productive and fulfilling life.

. To achieve the goals in subsection (3) of this section, to promote public health and safety, and to promote the efficient and economic use of funding for the medicaid program under Title XIX of the social security act, the authority may seek, receive, and expend alternative sources of funding to support all aspects of the state's response to the opioid crisis.

. The authority must partner with the department of social and health services, the department of corrections, the department of health, the department of children, youth, and families, and any other agencies or entities the authority deems appropriate to develop a statewide approach to leveraging medicaid funding to treat opioid use disorder and provide emergency overdose treatment. Such alternative sources of funding may include:

.. Seeking a section 1115 demonstration waiver from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services to fund opioid treatment medications for persons eligible for medicaid at or during the time of incarceration and juvenile detention facilities; and

.. Soliciting and receiving private funds, grants, and donations from any willing person or entity.

. [Empty]
.. The authority shall work with the department of health to promote coordination between medication-assisted treatment prescribers, federally accredited opioid treatment programs, substance use disorder treatment facilities, and state-certified substance use disorder treatment agencies to:

... Increase patient choice in receiving medication and counseling;

... Strengthen relationships between opioid use disorder providers;

... Acknowledge and address the challenges presented for individuals needing treatment for multiple substance use disorders simultaneously; and

... Study and review effective methods to identify and reach out to individuals with opioid use disorder who are at high risk of overdose and not involved in traditional systems of care, such as homeless individuals using syringe service programs, and connect such individuals to appropriate treatment.

.. The authority must work with stakeholders to develop a set of recommendations to the governor and the legislature that:

... Propose, in addition to those required by federal law, a standard set of services needed to support the complex treatment needs of persons with opioid use disorder treated in opioid treatment programs;

... Outline the components of and strategies needed to develop opioid treatment program centers of excellence that provide fully integrated care for persons with opioid use disorder;

... Estimate the costs needed to support these models and recommendations for funding strategies that must be included in the report;

... Outline strategies to increase the number of waivered health care providers approved for prescribing buprenorphine by the substance abuse and mental health services administration; and

.. Outline strategies to lower the cost of federal food and drug administration approved products for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

. State agencies shall review and promote positive outcomes associated with the accountable communities of health funded opioid projects and local law enforcement and human services opioid collaborations as set forth in the Washington state interagency opioid working plan.

. The authority must partner with the department and other state agencies to replicate effective approaches for linking individuals who have had a nonfatal overdose with treatment opportunities, with a goal to connect certified peer counselors with individuals who have had a nonfatal overdose.

. State agencies must work together to increase outreach and education about opioid overdoses to non-English-speaking communities by developing a plan to conduct outreach and education to non-English-speaking communities. The department must submit a report on the outreach and education plan with recommendations for implementation to the appropriate legislative committees by July 1, 2020.

.. The behavioral health agency may not balance bill, as defined in RCW  48.43.005.

. When the treatment plan approved by the managed care organization involves transfer of the enrollee to a different facility or to a lower level of care, the care coordination unit of the managed care organization shall work with the current agency to make arrangements for a seamless transfer as soon as possible to an appropriate and available facility or level of care. The managed care organization shall pay the agency for the cost of care at the current facility until the seamless transfer to the different facility or lower level of care is complete. A seamless transfer to a lower level of care may include same day or next day appointments for outpatient care, and does not include payment for nontreatment services, such as housing services. If placement with an agency in the managed care organization's network is not available, the managed care organization shall pay the current agency at the service level until a seamless transfer arrangement is made.

.. Discussing whether the managed health care systems awarded the contract by the authority for a regional service area should subcontract with a county-based administrative service organization or other local organization, which may include and determine, in partnership with that organization, which value-add services will best support a bidirectional system of care.

. To ensure an optimal transition, regional service areas that enter as mid-adopters must be allowed a transition period of up to one year during which the interlocal leadership structure develops and implements a local plan, including measurable milestones, to transition to fully integrated managed care. The transition plan may include provisions for the counties' organization to maintain existing contracts during some or all of the transition period if the managed care design begins during 2017 to 2018, with the mid-adopter transition year occurring in 2019.

. Nothing in this section may be used to compel contracts between a provider, integrated managed health care system, or administrative service organization.

. The interlocal leadership group expires December 1, 2021, unless the interlocal leadership group decides locally to extend it.

== 71.24.885 - Medicaid rate increases—Review authority—Reporting.
. It is the intent of the legislature that behavioral health medicaid rate increases be grounded with the rate-setting process for the provider type or practice setting.

. In implementing a rate increase funded by the legislature, including rate increases provided through managed care organizations, the authority must work with the actuaries responsible for establishing medicaid rates for behavioral health services and managed care organizations responsible for distributing funds to behavioral health services to assure that appropriate adjustments are made to the wraparound with intensive services case rate, as well as any other behavioral health services in which a case rate is used.

. [Empty]
..

The process must include a method for determining if the funds have increased access to the behavioral health services offered by the behavioral health providers who are the subject of the targeted provider rate increases.

.. The process may:

... Include a quantitative method for determining if the funds have increased access to behavioral health services offered by the behavioral health providers who received the targeted provider rate increases;

... Ensure the viability of pass-through payments in a capitated rate methodology; and

... Ensure that medicaid rate increases account for the impact of value-based contracting on provider reimbursements and implementations of pass-through payments.

. By November 1st of each year, the authority shall report to the committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over behavioral health issues and fiscal matters regarding the established process for each appropriation for a targeted behavioral health provider rate increase, whether the funds were passed through in accordance with the appropriation language, and any information about increased access to behavioral health services associated with the appropriation. The reporting requirement for each appropriation for a targeted behavioral health provider rate increase shall continue for two years following the specific appropriation.
