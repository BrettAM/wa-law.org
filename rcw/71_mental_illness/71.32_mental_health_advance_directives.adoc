:toc:

== 71.32.010 - Legislative declaration—Findings.
. The legislature declares that an individual with capacity has the ability to control decisions relating to his or her own mental health care. The legislature finds that:

.. Some mental illnesses cause individuals to fluctuate between capacity and incapacity;

.. During periods when an individual's capacity is unclear, the individual may be unable to access needed treatment because the individual may be unable to give informed consent;

.. Early treatment may prevent an individual from becoming so ill that involuntary treatment is necessary; and

.. Mentally ill individuals need some method of expressing their instructions and preferences for treatment and providing advance consent to or refusal of treatment.

The legislature recognizes that a mental health advance directive can be an essential tool for an individual to express his or her choices at a time when the effects of mental illness have not deprived him or her of the power to express his or her instructions or preferences.

. The legislature further finds that:

.. A mental health advance directive must provide the individual with a full range of choices;

.. Mentally ill individuals have varying perspectives on whether they want to be able to revoke a directive during periods of incapacity;

.. For a mental health advance directive to be an effective tool, individuals must be able to choose how they want their directives treated during periods of incapacity; and

.. There must be clear standards so that treatment providers can readily discern an individual's treatment choices.

Consequently, the legislature affirms that, pursuant to other provisions of law, a validly executed mental health advance directive is to be respected by agents, guardians, and other surrogate decision makers, health care providers, professional persons, and health care facilities.

== 71.32.080 - Revocation—Waiver.
. [Empty]
.. A principal with capacity may, by written statement by the principal or at the principal's direction in the principal's presence, revoke a directive in whole or in part.

.. An incapacitated principal may revoke a directive only if he or she elected at the time of executing the directive to be able to revoke when incapacitated.

. The revocation need not follow any specific form so long as it is written and the intent of the principal can be discerned. In the case of a directive that is stored in the health care declarations registry created by RCW 70.122.130, the revocation may be by an online method established by the department of health. Failure to use the online method of revocation for a directive that is stored in the registry does not invalidate a revocation that is made by another method described under this section.

. The principal shall provide a copy of his or her written statement of revocation to his or her agent, if any, and to each health care provider, professional person, or health care facility that received a copy of the directive from the principal.

. The written statement of revocation is effective:

.. As to a health care provider, professional person, or health care facility, upon receipt. The professional person, health care provider, or health care facility, or persons acting under their direction shall make the statement of revocation part of the principal's medical record; and

.. As to the principal's agent, upon receipt. The principal's agent shall notify the principal's health care provider, professional person, or health care facility of the revocation and provide them with a copy of the written statement of revocation.

. A directive also may:

.. Be revoked, in whole or in part, expressly or to the extent of any inconsistency, by a subsequent directive; or

.. Be superseded or revoked by a court order, including any order entered in a criminal matter. A directive may be superseded by a court order regardless of whether the order contains an explicit reference to the directive. To the extent a directive is not in conflict with a court order, the directive remains effective, subject to the provisions of RCW 71.32.150. A directive shall not be interpreted in a manner that interferes with: (i) Incarceration or detention by the department of corrections, in a city or county jail, or by the department of social and health services; or (ii) treatment of a principal who is subject to involuntary treatment pursuant to chapter 10.77, 71.05, 71.09, or 71.34 RCW.

. A directive that would have otherwise expired but is effective because the principal is incapacitated remains effective until the principal is no longer incapacitated unless the principal has elected to be able to revoke while incapacitated and has revoked the directive.

. When a principal with capacity consents to treatment that differs from, or refuses treatment consented to in, the provisions of his or her directive, the consent or refusal constitutes a waiver of that provision and does not constitute a revocation of the provision or directive unless the principal also revokes the directive or provision.

. An agent must act in good faith.

. An agent may make decisions on behalf of the principal. Unless the principal has revoked the directive, the decisions must be consistent with the instructions and preferences the principal has expressed in the directive, or if not expressed, as otherwise known to the agent.

. Except to the extent the right is limited by the appointment or any federal or state law, the agent has the same right as the principal to receive, review, and authorize the use and disclosure of the principal's health care information when the agent is acting on behalf of the principal and to the extent required for the agent to carry out his or her duties. This subsection shall be construed to be consistent with chapters 70.02, 70.24, *70.96A, 71.05, and 71.34 RCW, and with federal law regarding health care information.

. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment and agreed to in writing by the agent, the agent is not, as a result of acting in the capacity of agent, personally liable for the cost of treatment provided to the principal.

. An agent may resign or withdraw at any time by giving written notice to the principal. The agent must also give written notice to any health care provider, professional person, or health care facility providing treatment to the principal. The resignation or withdrawal is effective upon receipt unless otherwise specified in the resignation or withdrawal.

. If the directive gives the agent authority to act while the principal has capacity, the decisions of the principal supersede those of the agent at any time the principal has capacity.

. Unless otherwise provided in the durable power of attorney, the principal may revoke the agent's appointment as provided under other state law.

Mental Health Advance Directive

NOTICE TO PERSONS

CREATING A MENTAL HEALTH ADVANCE DIRECTIVE

This is an important legal document. It creates an advance directive for mental health treatment. Before signing this document you should know these important facts:

. This document is called an advance directive and allows you to make decisions in advance about your mental health treatment, including medications, short-term admission to inpatient treatment and electroconvulsive therapy.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FILL OUT OR SIGN THIS FORM.

IF YOU DO NOT SIGN THIS FORM, IT WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT.

If you choose to complete and sign this document, you may still decide to leave some items blank.

. You have the right to appoint a person as your agent to make treatment decisions for you. You must notify your agent that you have appointed him or her as an agent. The person you appoint has a duty to act consistently with your wishes made known by you. If your agent does not know what your wishes are, he or she has a duty to act in your best interest. Your agent has the right to withdraw from the appointment at any time.

. The instructions you include with this advance directive and the authority you give your agent to act will only become effective under the conditions you select in this document. You may choose to limit this directive and your agent's authority to times when you are incapacitated or to times when you are exhibiting symptoms or behavior that you specify. You may also make this directive effective immediately. No matter when you choose to make this directive effective, your treatment providers must still seek your informed consent at all times that you have capacity to give informed consent.

. You have the right to revoke this document in writing at any time you have capacity.

YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DIRECTIVE WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE

INCAPACITATED UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIFICALLY STATED IN THIS DIRECTIVE THAT

YOU WANT IT TO BE REVOCABLE WHEN YOU ARE INCAPACITATED.

. This directive will stay in effect until you revoke it unless you specify an expiration date. If you specify an expiration date and you are incapacitated at the time it expires, it will remain in effect until you have capacity to make treatment decisions again unless you chose to be able to revoke it while you are incapacitated and you revoke the directive.

. You cannot use your advance directive to consent to civil commitment. The procedures that apply to your advance directive are different than those provided for in the Involuntary Treatment Act. Involuntary treatment is a different process.

. If there is anything in this directive that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.

. You should be aware that there are some circumstances where your provider may not have to follow your directive.

. You should discuss any treatment decisions in your directive with your provider.

. You may ask the court to rule on the validity of your directive.



PART I.

STATEMENT OF INTENT TO CREATE A

MENTAL HEALTH ADVANCE DIRECTIVE

I, . . . . . . . . . . being a person with capacity, willfully and voluntarily execute this mental health advance directive so that my choices regarding my mental health care will be carried out in circumstances when I am unable to express my instructions and preferences regarding my mental health care. If a guardian is appointed by a court to make mental health decisions for me, I intend this document to take precedence over all other means of ascertaining my intent.

The fact that I may have left blanks in this directive does not affect its validity in any way. I intend that all completed sections be followed. If I have not expressed a choice, my agent should make the decision that he or she determines is in my best interest. I intend this directive to take precedence over any other directives I have previously executed, to the extent that they are inconsistent with this document, or unless I expressly state otherwise in either document.

I understand that I may revoke this directive in whole or in part if I am a person with capacity. I understand that I cannot revoke this directive if a court, two health care providers, or one mental health professional and one health care provider find that I am an incapacitated person, unless, when I executed this directive, I chose to be able to revoke this directive while incapacitated.

I understand that, except as otherwise provided in law, revocation must be in writing. I understand that nothing in this directive, or in my refusal of treatment to which I consent in this directive, authorizes any health care provider, professional person, health care facility, or agent appointed in this directive to use or threaten to use abuse, neglect, financial exploitation, or abandonment to carry out my directive.

I understand that there are some circumstances where my provider may not have to follow my directive.

. . . . . . Even if I am incapacitated.
