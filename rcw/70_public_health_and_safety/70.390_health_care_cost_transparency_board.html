The board shall first identify existing data sources, such as the statewide health care claims database established in chapter 43.371 RCW and prescription drug data collected under chapter 43.71C RCW, and primarily rely on these sources when possible in order to minimize the creation of new reporting requirements;</p>
<p>b. Determine the means and methods for gathering data to annually calculate total health care expenditures and health care cost growth, and to establish the health care cost growth benchmark. The board must select an appropriate economic indicator to use when establishing the health care cost growth benchmark. The activities may include selecting methodologies and determining sources of data. The board shall accept recommendations from the advisory committee on data issues and the advisory committee of health care providers and carriers regarding the value and feasibility of reporting various categories of information under (c) of this subsection, such as urban and rural, public sector and private sector, and major categories of health services, including prescription drugs, inpatient treatment, and outpatient treatment;</p>
<p>c. Annually calculate total health care expenditures and health care cost growth:</p>
<pre><code> i. Statewide and by geographic rating area;

 ii. For each health care provider or provider system and each payer, taking into account the health status of the patients of the health care provider or the enrollees of the payer, utilization by the patients of the health care provider or the enrollees of the payer, intensity of services provided to the patients of the health care provider or the enrollees of the payer, and regional differences in input prices. The board must develop an implementation plan for reporting information about health care providers, provider systems, and payers;

 iii. By market segment;

 iv. Per capita; and
</code></pre>
<p>v. For other categories, as recommended by the advisory committees in (b) of this subsection, and approved by the board;</p>
<p>d. Annually establish the health care cost growth benchmark for increases in total health expenditures. The board, in determining the health care cost growth benchmark, shall begin with an initial implementation that applies to the highest cost drivers in the health care system and develop a phased plan to include other components of the health system for subsequent years;</p>
<p>e. Beginning in 2023, analyze the impacts of cost drivers to health care and incorporate this analysis into determining the annual total health care expenditures and establishing the annual health care cost growth benchmark. The cost drivers may include, to the extent such data is available:</p>
<pre><code> i. Labor, including but not limited to, wages, benefits, and salaries;

 ii. Capital costs, including but not limited to new technology;

 iii. Supply costs, including but not limited to prescription drug costs;

 iv. Uncompensated care;
</code></pre>
<p>v. Administrative and compliance costs;</p>
<p>vi. Federal, state, and local taxes;</p>
<p>vii. Capacity, funding, and access to postacute care, long-term services and supports, and housing; and</p>
<p>viii. Regional differences in input prices; and</p>
<p>f. Release reports in accordance with RCW 70.390.070.</p>
