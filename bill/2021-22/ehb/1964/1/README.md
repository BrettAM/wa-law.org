## Section 2
1. Except as provided under subsection (2) of this section, an alternative energy facility agreement executed on or after the effective date of this section must provide that a grantee is responsible for decommissioning the grantee's alternative energy facility on the surface property owner's property in accordance with this chapter no later than 18 months after the facility has ceased producing electricity.

2. Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a grantee who is actively working to recommence production of electricity, including an instance following the occurrence of a force majeure or similar event.


## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. A grantee who executes an alternative energy facility agreement on or after the effective date of this section must provide a decommissioning plan and submit proof to the applicable county auditor and applicable county planning department of financial assurance from either:

        i. A financial institution, as defined in RCW 31.12.005;

        ii. A trust institution, as authorized in RCW 30B.04.030; or

    b. The financial assurance must conform to the requirements under this chapter to secure the performance of the grantee's obligation to decommission the grantee's alternative energy facility.

2. The amount of financial assurance guaranteed must be at least equal to the cost of decommissioning the alternative energy facility in accordance with section 4 of this act and must be calculated and updated every five years by an independent third-party professional engineer retained by the grantee from a list of professional engineers compiled by the department and published on the department's publicly accessible internet website. The cost of decommissioning must be based on the costs to the grantee of hiring a third party to close the alternative energy facility. The amount of financial assurance may not be calculated to be less than $10,000 per megawatt as measured in nominal alternating current nameplate capacity for an alternative energy facility. The amount of financial assurance must include a contingency factor of not less than 20 percent of the cost of decommissioning the alternative energy facility.

3. A grantee must deliver a decommissioning plan and proof of financial assurance to the county auditor and county planning department in accordance with the following:

    a. No later than 30 days before the commencement of construction of the alternative energy facility, the grantee must provide the decommissioning plan and proof of financial assurance to the county auditor and county planning department in an amount equal to 20 percent of the cost of decommissioning as determined by a third-party professional engineer, less an offset equal to 80 percent of the applicable salvage value.

    b. On or before the fifth anniversary of the commencement of construction of the alternative energy facility, the grantee must provide an updated decommissioning plan and proof of financial assurance to the county auditor and county planning department in an amount equal to 40 percent of the cost of decommissioning as determined by an independent third-party professional engineer, less an offset equal to 60 percent of the applicable salvage value.

    c. On or before the 10th anniversary of the commencement of construction of the alternative energy facility, the grantee must provide an updated decommissioning plan and proof of financial assurance to the county auditor and county planning department in an amount equal to 60 percent of the cost of decommissioning as determined by an independent third-party professional engineer, less an offset equal to 40 percent of the applicable salvage value.

    d. On or before the 15th anniversary of the commencement of construction of the alternative energy facility, the grantee must provide an updated decommissioning plan and proof of financial assurance to the county auditor and county planning department in an amount equal to 80 percent of the cost of decommissioning as determined by an independent third-party professional engineer, less an offset equal to 20 percent of the applicable salvage value.

    e. On or before the 20th anniversary of the commencement of construction of the alternative energy facility, the grantee must provide an updated decommissioning plan and proof of financial assurance to the county auditor and county planning department in an amount equal to 100 percent of the cost of decommissioning as determined by an independent third-party professional engineer.

4. Acceptable methods of financial assurance include a bond or a trust account, a letter of credit, and any other form of financial assurance as developed in the course of rule making pursuant to section 4 of this act.


## Section 4

No more than 20 percent of the total combined mass of an alternative energy facility may enter into a landfill as part of the grantee's decommissioning plan.Â For the purpose of determining the total combined mass under this subsection, the total combined mass includes wind turbines, solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbine blades, meteorological towers, guy wires, auxiliary equipment, and steel support structures. Cement support structures may not be considered when determining the total combined mass under this subsection; and

    c. The financial assurance specified under section 3 of this act.


## Section 5
The regulation of the decommissioning of alternative energy facilities is a matter of general statewide interest that requires uniform statewide regulation. This chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter constitute a comprehensive plan with respect to all aspects of alternative energy facility agreements, financial assurance, and decommissioning plans associated with alternative energy facilities within this state. Any county, municipal, or other local government ordinance or regulation that materially impedes the purposes of this chapter, including any ordinance or regulation that requires a grantee to provide proof of financial assurance in an amount greater than the amounts set forth in section 3 of this act, is preempted and is without force and effect.


## Section 6
This chapter does not apply to any of the following:

1. A nonutility owner or operator of a net metered distributed generation system with a nameplate capacity of not greater than 3,000 kilowatts; and

2. An owner or operator of a farm who owns and operates an alternative energy facility on the farm premises, regardless of the location or consumption of the energy generated.
