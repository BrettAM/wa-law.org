<p>(1) The legislature finds that many workers who have paid into the paid family and medical leave insurance program have suffered job losses, reductions in hours, or an inability to reenter the workforce due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These workers are unable to access their family and medical leave benefits under the existing hours worked threshold through no fault of their own.
(2) The legislature intends to temporarily adjust the qualifying periods for these adversely impacted workers to restore access to family and medical leave benefits.
(3) In the temporary adjustment of the qualifying period for these workers, the legislature intends to prevent impacts to the family and medical leave insurance account through the provision of separate funding. In so doing, the legislature intends to avoid any premium rate increases or the application of a solvency surcharge.</p>
