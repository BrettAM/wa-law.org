# Second Substitute House Bill 1073 as Recommended by Appropriations

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1073-S2.xml)
## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that many workers who have paid into the paid family and medical leave insurance program have suffered job losses, reductions in hours, or an inability to reenter the workforce due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These workers are unable to access their family and medical leave benefits under the existing hours worked threshold through no fault of their own.
(2) The legislature intends to temporarily adjust the qualifying periods for these adversely impacted workers to restore access to family and medical leave benefits.
(3) In the temporary adjustment of the qualifying period for these workers, the legislature intends to prevent impacts to the family and medical leave insurance account through the provision of separate funding. In so doing, the legislature intends to avoid any premium rate increases or the application of a solvency surcharge.

## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [50A.15.010](/rcw/50A_family_and_medical_leave/50A.15_benefits.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50A_family_and_medical_leave/50A.15_benefits.md) for context.

**Except as provided in section 3 of this act, employees** are eligible for family and medical leave benefits as provided in this title after working for at least eight hundred twenty hours in employment during the qualifying period.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [50A.30.020](/rcw/50A_family_and_medical_leave/50A.30_voluntary_plans.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50A_family_and_medical_leave/50A.30_voluntary_plans.md) for context.

1. **Except as provided in section 3 of this act, to** be eligible for any family and medical leave, an employee must be in employment for eight hundred twenty hours during the qualifying period, by an employer with a voluntary plan or an employer utilizing the state family and medical leave plan. An employee qualifies for benefits under an employer's voluntary plan after the employee works at least three hundred forty hours for the current employer.

2. An employer with an approved voluntary plan may waive the requirements in subsection (1) of this section, in whole or in part, to allow an employee to be immediately eligible for coverage under the employer's voluntary plan.

3. An employee who had coverage under the state plan retains coverage under the state plan until such time as the employee is qualified for coverage under the new employer's voluntary plan.

4. An employee who was eligible for benefits under a voluntary plan is immediately eligible for benefits under a new employer's voluntary plan.


## Section 5
