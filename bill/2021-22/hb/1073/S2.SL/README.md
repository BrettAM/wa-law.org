## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that many Washington workers have suffered direct effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the unprecedented global shutdown in response to COVID-19, many Washington workers who have paid into the paid family and medical leave insurance program are unable to access their benefits through no fault of their own. Workers recovering from COVID-19 or caring for an individual who is severely ill due to COVID-19 are unable to access their benefits.
(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to provide financial assistance to workers who are not otherwise eligible for paid family and medical leave due to COVID-19's impact on their ability to meet the hours worked threshold. The legislature intends to provide a pandemic leave assistance employee grant to provide an equivalent benefit to what the worker would otherwise be eligible to receive under the paid family and medical leave insurance program. Additionally, the legislature intends to provide a pandemic leave assistance employer grant to help offset small business employers' costs related to employees on leave who are receiving a pandemic leave assistance employee grant.
(3) The legislature intends to utilize federal funding from the America rescue plan act to provide financial assistance to COVID-19 impacted workers. The legislature does not intend for this worker assistance to affect the state's paid family and medical leave insurance account.

## Section 4
Nothing in this act shall be construed to limit or interfere with the requirements, rights, and responsibilities of employers and employees under Title 50A RCW, except as provided in this act. Employees and employers receiving a grant under section 2 or 3 of this act must comply with all provisions of Title 50A RCW and any rules promulgated thereunder.

## Section 5
The employment security department may adopt rules to implement this act.
