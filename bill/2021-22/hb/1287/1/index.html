<p>(1) Motor vehicles are a significant source of air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, in Washington. The transportation sector accounts for nearly one-half of greenhouse gas emissions in Washington, and on-road vehicle emissions are responsible for the vast majority of the transportation sector emissions.
(2) The widespread adoption of zero emissions vehicles is essential to the achievement of the state emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, which, by 2050, requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 5,000,000 metric tons and the achievement of net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The rapid uptake of zero emissions vehicles is also an essential component of the state energy strategy, which calls for the phase out of vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel by mid-century. To ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to facilitate zero emissions vehicle adoption, the state energy strategy calls for the establishment of building codes that require installation of the conduit, wiring, and panel capacity necessary to support electric vehicle charging in new and retrofitted buildings.
(3) In 2005, Washington first took action to adopt some of the motor vehicle emissions standards of the state of California, which are more protective of human health and the environment than federal motor vehicle emissions standards. In 2020, the legislature directed the department of ecology to adopt all of California's motor vehicle emissions standards, including California's zero emissions vehicles program.
(4) A Washington state transition to a zero emissions transportation future requires accurate forecasting of zero emissions vehicle adoption rates, comprehensive planning for the necessary electric vehicle charging and refueling infrastructure, and managing the load of charging and refueling infrastructure as a dynamic energy service to the electric grid.
(5) To ensure that the transition to a zero emissions transportation future proceeds efficiently and conveniently for users and operators of the multimodal transportation system, it is the intent of the legislature to:
(a) Require state government to provide resources that facilitate the planning and deployment of electric vehicle charging and refueling infrastructure in a transparent, effective, and equitable manner across the state;
(b) Ensure utility resource planning analyzes the impacts on electricity generation and delivery from growing adoption and usage of electric vehicles; and
(c) Require state building codes that support the anticipated levels of zero emissions vehicle use that result from the program requirements in chapter 70A.30 RCW and that achieve emissions reductions consistent with RCW 70A.45.020.</p>

<p>b. An assessment of commercially available conservation and efficiency resources, as informed, as applicable, by the assessment for conservation potential under RCW 19.285.040 for the planning horizon consistent with (a) of this subsection. Such assessment may include, as appropriate, opportunities for development of combined heat and power as an energy and capacity resource, demand response and load management programs, and currently employed and new policies and programs needed to obtain the conservation and efficiency resources;</p>
<p>c. An assessment of commercially available, utility scale renewable and nonrenewable generating technologies including a comparison of the benefits and risks of purchasing power or building new resources;</p>
<p>d. A comparative evaluation of renewable and nonrenewable generating resources, including transmission and distribution delivery costs, and conservation and efficiency resources using &quot;lowest reasonable cost&quot; as a criterion;</p>
<p>e. An assessment of methods, commercially available technologies, or facilities for integrating renewable resources, including but not limited to battery storage and pumped storage, and addressing overgeneration events, if applicable to the utility's resource portfolio;</p>
<p>f. An assessment and ten-year forecast of the availability of regional generation and transmission capacity on which the utility may rely to provide and deliver electricity to its customers;</p>
<p>g. A determination of resource adequacy metrics for the resource plan consistent with the forecasts;</p>
<p>h. A forecast of distributed energy resources that may be installed by the utility's customers and an assessment of their effect on the utility's load and operations;</p>
<p>i. An identification of an appropriate resource adequacy requirement and measurement metric consistent with prudent utility practice in implementing RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050;</p>
<p>j. The integration of the demand forecasts, resource evaluations, and resource adequacy requirement into a long‑range assessment describing the mix of supply side generating resources and conservation and efficiency resources that will meet current and projected needs, including mitigating overgeneration events and implementing RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050, at the lowest reasonable cost and risk to the utility and its customers, while maintaining and protecting the safety, reliable operation, and balancing of its electric system;</p>
<p>k. An assessment, informed by the cumulative impact analysis conducted under RCW 19.405.140, of: Energy and nonenergy benefits and reductions of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health and environmental benefits, costs, and risks; and energy security and risk;</p>
<p>l. A ten-year clean energy action plan for implementing RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050 at the lowest reasonable cost, and at an acceptable resource adequacy standard, that identifies the specific actions to be taken by the utility consistent with the long‑range integrated resource plan**; and**</p>
<p>m. <strong>An analysis of how the plan supports and accounts for:</strong></p>
