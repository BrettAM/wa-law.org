<p>There is a craft cannabis producer/processor license available to applicants meeting the qualifications and requirements in this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the privileges and requirements of a craft cannabis producer/processor license issued under this section are the same privileges and requirements of a marijuana producer license and of a marijuana processor license issued under RCW 69.50.325. To qualify for a craft cannabis producer/processor license an applicant must meet all qualifications for a marijuana license in RCW 69.50.331.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>

<p>b. [Empty]</p>
<pre><code> i. The board shall establish a reduced application fee and reduced license fee for a craft cannabis producer/processor applicant or licensee who meets the definition of a social equity applicant in this section.

 ii. For an applicant who switches from operating under two marijuana producer licenses to one license under this section, the annual license fee is $4,143 if the licensee is authorized to have up to an additional 30,000 square feet of seasonal sungrown production canopy in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

<p>a. The holder of a craft cannabis producer/processor license may not hold any other marijuana license issued under this chapter, including another craft cannabis producer/processor license, or have an ownership interest in, management role in, or exercise control over a business or entity that holds any other marijuana license or craft cannabis producer/processor license issued under this chapter.</p>
<p>b. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, a craft cannabis producer/processor licensee is subject to the following production and processing limits:</p>
<pre><code> i. If production is indoors, the licensee may have no more than 10,000 square feet of production canopy;

 ii. If production is seasonal sungrown production, the licensee may have no more than 30,000 square feet of production canopy; and

 iii. If production is at a facility at which marijuana is cultivated by indoor production and seasonal sungrown production, the licensee must have less than 10,000 square feet of indoor production canopy. Additionally, the licensee may have seasonal sungrown production canopy equal to three times the difference between 10,000 square feet and the number of square feet of indoor production canopy authorized for the licensee.

The board may deny any application submitted under this subsection if the board determines that the application does not meet social equity goals, does not meet social equity plan requirements, or the application does not otherwise meet the licensing requirements of this chapter.

 ii. In addition to licenses issued through (c)(i) of this subsection, the board shall issue a craft cannabis producer/processor license to all currently licensed marijuana producers who qualify and choose to be licensed under this section instead of RCW 69.50.325.
