<h2 id="section-1-839">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-839">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature finds that the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee has produced a valuable, comprehensive suicide prevention plan. This plan finds that about one-half of mental health conditions appear by age 14 and identifies a need for preventing youth suicide risk farther upstream in a child's life.
(2) The legislature intends to establish a youth suicide review team to complement the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee by providing a focused investigation of the lives of youth who have died by suicide. The work of the review team shall:
(a) Provide a more detailed picture of the lives of youth who have died by suicide in Washington to allow for more targeted intervention programs to reach youth earlier in their lives; and
(b) Help determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic or the state's response to the pandemic have impacted youth suicide rates.</p>
