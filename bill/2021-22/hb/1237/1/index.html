<li>
<p>This act is intended to provide a common definition for family resource centers across Washington state in an effort to establish a core set of principles for existing and newly forming family resource centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that family resource centers are effective in supporting communities when adhering to the following principles:</p>
<p>a. Equality;</p>
<p>b. Mutual respect;</p>
<p>c. Families are resources to other families and the community;</p>
<p>d. Strengthening families' cultural, racial, and linguistic identities;</p>
<p>e. Embedding programs in the community;</p>
<p>f. Fairness;</p>
<p>g. Responsiveness;</p>
<p>h. Accountability;</p>
<p>i. Mobilization of formal and informal resources; and</p>
<p>j. Flexibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that families and parents are primarily responsible for supporting children's development and well-being at all ages and stages, and for preparing a child for success in school and life. However, many families may benefit from voluntary preventative or enriching support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that family resource centers play a critical role in:</p>
<p>a. Preventing child abuse and neglect;</p>
<p>b. Strengthening children and families;</p>
<p>c. Connecting family-impacting agencies and programs;</p>
<p>d. Creating opportunities for community-level coordination; and</p>
<p>e. Creating connections to resources and support systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
