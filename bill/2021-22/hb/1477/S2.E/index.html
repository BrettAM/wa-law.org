<p>(1) The legislature finds that:
(a) Nearly 6,000 Washington adults and children died by suicide in the last five years, according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, tragically reflecting a state increase of 36 percent in the last 10 years.
(b) Suicide is now the single leading cause of death for Washington young people ages 10 through 24, with total deaths 22 percent higher than for vehicle crashes.
(c) Groups with suicide rates higher than the general population include veterans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, LGBTQ youth, and people living in rural counties across the state.
(d) More than one in five Washington residents are currently living with a behavioral health disorder.
(e) The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stressors and substance use among Washington residents.
(f) An improved crisis response system will reduce reliance on emergency room services and the use of law enforcement response to behavioral health crises and will stabilize individuals in the community whenever possible.
(2) The legislature intends to establish crisis call center hubs and expand the crisis delivery system in a deliberate, phased approach that includes the involvement of partners from a range of perspectives to:
(a) Save lives by improving the quality of and access to behavioral health crisis services;
(b) Further equity in addressing mental health and substance use treatment and assure a culturally and linguistically competent response to behavioral health crises;
(c) Recognize that, historically, crisis response placed marginalized communities, including those experiencing behavioral health crises, at disproportionate risk of poor outcomes and criminal justice involvement;
(d) Comply with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020 and the federal communication commission's rules adopted July 16, 2020, to assure that all Washington residents receive a consistent and effective level of 988 and crisis behavioral health services no matter where they live, work, or travel in the state; and
(e) Provide higher quality support for people experiencing behavioral health crises through investment in new technology to create a crisis call center hub system to triage calls and link individuals to follow-up care. Other investments include the expansion of crisis teams, to be known as mobile rapid response crisis teams, as well as a wide array of crisis stabilization services such as 23-hour crisis stabilization units based on the living room model, crisis stabilization centers, short-term respite facilities, peer-operated respite services, and behavioral health urgent care walk-in centers. The overall crisis system shall contain components that operate like hospital emergency departments that accept all walk-ins, and ambulance, fire, and police drop-offs. The use of peers must be incorporated as often as possible within the continuum of crisis care.</p>
