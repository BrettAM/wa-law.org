## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [43.88A.010](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.088A_legislative_fiscal_notes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.088A_legislative_fiscal_notes.md) for context.

The legislature hereby recognizes the necessity of developing a uniform and coordinated procedure for determining the expected fiscal impact of bills and resolutions on state government. The legislature also recognizes that developing **these** statements of fiscal impact requires the designation of a state agency to be principally responsible **for the statements. The statements are to be generally known as fiscal notes and dynamic fiscal impact statements. Dynamic fiscal impact statements may be included in certain fiscal notes in accordance with section 2 of this act**.


## Section 3
(1)(a) The legislature recognizes the increasing importance of having complete information to establish and enforce budgetary priorities, coordinate actions on spending and revenue legislation, and develop budgetary and economic information independently of the executive branch.
(b) The legislature finds it is important for the legislature to have the best available information about the longer-term and holistic impact of budget decisions, particularly in light of the four-year balanced budget requirement.
(2)(a) The director of the house of representatives office of program research and the director of senate committee services shall convene a work group to explore ways to improve and expand nonpartisan fiscal and program information available to the legislature. The directors are the cochairs of the work group.
(b) The work group shall conduct a study of the accuracy and reliability of fiscal notes by examining a sample of fiscal notes on enacted legislation to compare the projected cost of the legislation with the actual costs incurred in the legislation's implementation.
(c) The work group shall also inventory nonpartisan program and fiscal information made available to the public by the legislative branch including, but not limited to, information posted at fiscal.wa.gov, the website for the legislative evaluation and accountability program, websites for the house of representatives and senate, the website of the joint legislative audit and review committee, and the website for the Washington state institute for public policy. The inventory should also include materials on the websites of the caseload forecast council and the economic and revenue forecast council. The work group must also inventory the use of dynamic spending and revenue estimates in other states, including their use in fiscal notes.
(d) The work group shall also recommend methods to:
(i) Improve the accuracy and timeliness of cost and revenue estimates for proposed legislation;
(ii) Improve the long-term budget projections for proposed and enacted budgets;
(iii) Improve and expand the regular reporting and analysis of state spending and revenue totals; and
(iv) To the extent practicable, include dynamic fiscal estimates in both revenue and expenditure estimates.
(e) As part of its work, the work group must analyze whether a new nonpartisan legislative fiscal agency should be created. In conducting the analysis, the work group must, at a minimum, examine models in other states including, but not limited to, the California legislative analyst's office. If the work group recommends the establishment of a new legislative agency, the recommendations must outline the responsibilities of the new nonpartisan legislative fiscal agency and whether any existing functions or entities should be transferred to or subsumed in the newly created nonpartisan legislative fiscal agency.
(f) In addition to the two cochairs, the work group is comprised of at least the following members:
(i) One member from each of the two largest caucuses of the senate chosen by the president of the senate;
(ii) One member from each of the two largest caucuses of the house of representatives chosen by the speaker of the house of representatives;
(iii) One representative from the legislative evaluation and accountability program committee;
(iv) One representative from the Washington state institute for public policy; and
(v) One representative from the office of financial management.
(g) The first meeting of the work group must occur no later than August 1, 2021.
(h) The work group shall report its findings and recommendations to the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature no later than December 1, 2022.
(3) This section expires December 31, 2022.
