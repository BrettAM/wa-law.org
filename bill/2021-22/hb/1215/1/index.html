<h2 id="section-1-55">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-55">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature recognizes that parents are uniquely and exclusively suited to making decisions about their children, including education decisions. It is imperative that Washington state empowers and supports parents and students to choose the educational environment that best suits their needs.
(2) The legislature finds that the state has authorized many education options including traditional public schools, charter schools, home-based instruction, and private schools. Parents with means can enroll their children in private schools, forego an income to provide home-based instruction, or move and enroll their children in better school districts. At the same time, there are many parents who do not have the means to choose the option that is best for their children. This increases inequity in the education system with the parents and children with the least means, but the most need, trapped in a failing school or a school that does not otherwise meet their needs.
(3) The legislature recognizes that the paramount duty of the state is to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, economic status, or sex.
(4) The legislature realizes the need to provide for in-person or hybrid schooling models for optimum learning for students, especially when public schools are not offering these options, for example during the COVID-19 pandemic.
(5) The legislature finds that with the recent United States supreme court decision in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, 140 S.Ct. 2246 (2020), now is the time to remedy years of discrimination against students who are not in the public school system.
(6) The legislature, therefore, intends to establish a voucher program that addresses educational inequities for students both inside and outside the public school system. The program will empower parents to choose the educational environment that best suits their children's unique needs regardless of income level or zip code by providing K-12 education scholarships.</p>
<h2 id="section-4-23">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-23">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/83_estate_taxation/83.100_estate_and_transfer_tax_act.html">83.100.230</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/83_estate_taxation/83.100_estate_and_transfer_tax_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The education legacy trust account is created in the state treasury. Money in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for support of the common schools**, funding the K-12 education scholarship program established under section 2 of this act**, and for expanding access to higher education through funding for new enrollments and financial aid, and other educational improvement efforts. During the 2015-2017, 2017-2019, and 2019-2021 fiscal biennia appropriations from the account may be made for support of early learning programs. It is the intent of the legislature that this policy will be continued in subsequent fiscal biennia.</p>
