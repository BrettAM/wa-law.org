## Section 1
(1) This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in this act. This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.
(2) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief for certain businesses or individuals, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).
(3) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to financially incentivize the formation and utilization of limited equity cooperatives, and to increase the availability of housing available to low-income households. It is the legislature's intent to exempt from taxation any real property owned by a limited equity cooperative when a majority of the property is used and occupied by low-income households.
(4)(a) To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference provided in section 2 of this act in achieving the specific public policy objectives described in subsection (3) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate, two years prior to the expiration of the tax preference: (i) Growth in the formation and utilization of limited equity cooperatives; (ii) growth in available units of affordable housing within limited equity cooperatives; and (iii) any other metric the joint legislative audit and review committee determines is relevant to measuring success of this exemption.
(b) If the review by the joint legislative audit and review committee finds that growth in the formation and utilization of limited equity cooperatives or growth in available units of affordable housing within limited equity cooperatives has occurred, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference.
(5) In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to:
(a) Initial applications for the preference as approved by the department of revenue under RCW 84.36.815;
(b) Annual financial statements for a limited equity cooperative claiming this tax preference; and
(c) Any other data necessary for the evaluation under subsection (4) of this section.

## Section 3
This act applies to taxes levied for collection in 2022 and thereafter.
