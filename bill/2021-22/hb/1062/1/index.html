<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses%E2%80%94stamp_taxes.html">66.24.055</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses%E2%80%94stamp_taxes.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is a license for spirits distributors to (a) sell spirits purchased from manufacturers, distillers, or suppliers including, without limitation, licensed Washington distilleries, licensed spirits importers, other Washington spirits distributors, or suppliers of foreign spirits located outside of the United States, to spirits retailers including, without limitation, spirits retail licensees, special occasion license holders, interstate common carrier license holders, restaurant spirits retailer license holders, spirits, beer, and wine private club license holders, hotel license holders, sports entertainment facility license holders, and spirits, beer, and wine nightclub license holders, and to other spirits distributors; and (b) export the same from the state.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>a. As limited by (b) of this subsection , each spirits distributor licensee must pay to the board, for deposit into the liquor revolving fund, a license issuance fee calculated as
</code></pre>
<p>five percent of the total revenue from all the licensee's sales of spirits made during the month for which the fee is due, respectively.</p>
<pre><code>b. The fee required under this subsection (2) is calculated only on sales of items which the licensee was the first spirits distributor in the state to have received:

    i. In the case of spirits manufactured in the state, from the distiller; or

    ii. In the case of spirits manufactured outside the state, from an authorized out‑of‑state supplier.

c.
</code></pre>
<p>A retail licensee selling for resale must pay a distributor license fee under the terms and conditions in this section on resales of spirits the licensee has purchased on which no other distributor license fee has been paid. <strong>A limited spirits retail licensee selling for resale must also pay a distributor license fee under the terms and conditions in this section on resales of spirits the licensee has purchased on which no other distributor license fee has been paid. The limited spirits retail licensee must report these sales and the funds must be designated as mitigation fee funds.</strong> The board must establish rules setting forth the frequency and timing of such payments and reporting of sales dollar volume by the licensee, with payments due quarterly in arrears. <strong>The board must process and distribute mitigation fee funds paid under this section in the same manner and subject to the same regulations as the mitigation fees established in section 2 of this act.</strong></p>
<pre><code>d. No spirits inventory may be subject to calculation of more than a single spirits distributor license issuance fee.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>In addition to the payment set forth in subsection (2) of this section, each spirits distributor licensee renewing its annual license must pay an annual license renewal fee of one thousand three hundred twenty dollars for each licensed location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no minimum facility size or capacity for spirits distributor licenses, and no limit on the number of such licenses issued to qualified applicants. License applicants must provide physical security of the product that is substantially as effective as the physical security of the distribution facilities currently operated by the board with respect to preventing pilferage. License issuances and renewals are subject to RCW 66.24.010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including without limitation rights of cities, towns, county legislative authorities, the public, churches, schools, and public institutions to object to or prevent issuance of local liquor licenses.</p>
