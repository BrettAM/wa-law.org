# House Bill 1217

## Section 1
(1) The legislature recognizes that the numerous cases in Washington state have addressed the application of the prospective and retroactive effect of the courts' decisions. While the courts have established a general rule favoring retroactivity, the legislature finds that the rule imposes an inequitable result in certain exceptional cases.
(2) The legislature intends to limit the retroactive effect of court decisions concerning overtime wage claims by delineating factors that establish inequitable results.

## Section 3
Section 2 of this act applies to all causes of action regarding overtime wage claims regardless of when the cause of action may have arisen. To the extent a cause of action has arisen before the effective date of this section, this section applies retroactively, and applies prospectively in all other respects.
