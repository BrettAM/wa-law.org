## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to enhance the budget development process by improving the information available for the governor and legislature when evaluating the budget requests of state agencies and for the legislature when evaluating the governor's budget proposal under RCW 43.88.030. The legislature establishes the zero-based review process in section 2 of this act to provide more thorough analysis of the programs and services provided by state agencies and to better prioritize the expenditure of public resources. The zero-based budget review process focuses on nonentitlement programs; mandatory entitlement programs receive a de facto zero-based budget review through regular caseload forecasts under chapter 43.88C RCW and per capita cost analysis.
