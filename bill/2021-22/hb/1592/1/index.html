<p>This act may be known and cited as the military spouse employment act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-293">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-293">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the lives of military spouses are dominated by frequent deployments and relocations, and one-third of military families move each year. Many military families depend on two incomes, and military spouses tend to be better educated than the civilian population, with approximately 34 to 50 percent working in fields that require a professional license. The length of time to credential after a move is a significant employment barrier, with one study finding 20 percent of military spouses waited at least 10 months for a license after moving to a new state. This wait contributes to higher rates of unemployment or underemployment for military spouses when compared to their civilian counterparts. Given the fiscal and economic constraints of military families and the readiness considerations of the department of defense, the legislature intends to help alleviate the career turmoil military spouses face while serving in our state.</p>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.340_military_spouses%E2%80%94professional_licensing.html">18.340.020</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.340_military_spouses%E2%80%94professional_licensing.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the extent resources are available:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each authority shall establish procedures to expedite the issuance of a license regulated by each such authority to a person:</p>
<p>a. Who is  licensed, certified, or registered, or has a permit in another state to perform professional services in that state;</p>
<p>b. Whose spouse is the subject of a military transfer to Washington; and</p>
<p>c. Who left employment in the other state to accompany the person's spouse to Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure must include a process for issuing the person a license<strong>within 30 days of submitting a completed application and all required supporting materials</strong>, if, in the opinion of the authority, the requirements for licensure, certification, registration, or obtaining a permit of such other state are substantially equivalent to that required in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each authority in this title shall develop a method and adopt rules to authorize a person who meets the criteria in  subsection (1)(a) <strong>through (c) of this section</strong> to perform services regulated by the authority in Washington by issuing the person a temporary license<strong>within 30 days of submitting a completed application and all required supporting materials. The license may be issued</strong> for a limited period of time to allow the person to perform services regulated by the authority while completing any specific additional requirements in Washington that are not related to training or practice standards of the profession that were not required in the other state in which the person is licensed, certified, or registered, or has a permit. Nothing in this section requires the authority to issue a temporary license if the standards of the other state are substantially unequal to Washington standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An applicant must state in the application that he or she:</p>
<p>a. Has requested verification from the other state or states that the person is currently licensed, certified, registered, or has a permit; and</p>
<p>b. Is not subject to any pending investigation, charges, or disciplinary action by the regulatory body of the other state or states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the authority finds reasonable cause to believe that an applicant falsely affirmed or stated either of the requirements under  subsection (4)(a) <strong>or (b) of this section</strong>, the authority may summarily suspend the license pending an investigation or further action to discipline or revoke the license.</p>
