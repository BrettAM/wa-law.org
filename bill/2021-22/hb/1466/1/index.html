<p>(1) The legislature finds that outdoor education has many benefits for students, for example promoting creativity and problem solving, developing social skills, improving classroom engagement, and increasing physical activity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many students have transitioned to distance learning; however, outdoor play and classmate interaction remain important for students and can be achieved using outdoor education. Outdoor environments have low rates of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19, so students and teachers can safely come together for in-person classes.
(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a pilot project to provide assistance to schools to provide access to outdoor education, bring students and teachers together for in-person classes, and to further investigate the benefits of outdoor, nature-based classrooms for Washington's children and families.</p>
