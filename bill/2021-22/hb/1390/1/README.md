## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, Washington high school athletes have not been able to participate in athletic programs. This has resulted in a reduced opportunity to showcase athletic talents that help these students get recruited by and receive athletic scholarships from universities and colleges. The legislature therefore intends to support Washington athletes by requiring the state's public four-year institutions of higher education to devote a portion of athletic scholarship funding to Washington athletes.
