[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1214-S.PL.xml)
## Section 1
(1) The legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact that interactions with police have on youth of color and on Black youth in particular. Not only are Black youth more likely than their white peers to have contact with police at a young age despite similar or lower rates of illegal behavior, but early police contact for Black youth is predictive of future arrests in a way that is not true for white youth.
(2) The legislature finds that schools should be a place in which all youth feel safe and it is imperative that school resource officers, school security officers, and other school safety and security staff do not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.
(3) The legislature recognizes that chapter 333, Laws of 2019 made significant improvements to the quality and transparency of school districts' school resource officer programs by implementing training and intergovernmental agreement requirements. However, the legislature intends to expand these requirements to other school safety and security staff. The legislature also expects to require on-the-job training. In addition, the legislature finds that in order to understand the full scope and impact of safety and security staff on school property, additional information must be collected and made publicly available.

## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [28A.320.124](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.320_provisions_applicable_to_all_districts.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.320_provisions_applicable_to_all_districts.md) for context.

**By the beginning of the 2021-22 school year, school districts that have safety and security staff working on school property when students are expected to be present must adopt, and periodically update, a policy and procedure that**:

    a. **Includes a** clear statement regarding **safety and security staff** duties and responsibilities related to student behavior and discipline that:

        i. Prohibits a school resource officer from becoming involved in formal school discipline situations that are the responsibility of school administrators; **and**

        ii.

) Recognizes that  trained **safety and security staff** know when to informally interact with students to reinforce school rules and when to enforce the law;

    b. **Clarifies** the circumstances under which teachers and school administrators may ask **safety and security staff** to intervene with a student;

    c.

**Explains how safety and security staff will be engaged in creating a positive school climate and positive relationships with students; and**

    d. **Describes the** process for families to file complaints with the school and**, when applicable, the** local law enforcement agency **or the company that provides the safety and security staff on contract** related to **safety and security staff** and a process for investigating and responding to complaints

.

2. **At the beginning of each school year, school districts that have safety and security staff working on school property must present to and discuss with students, and distribute to students' families, information about the role and responsibilities of safety and security staff.**

3. **The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.**

    a. **"Safety and security staff" means a school resource officer, a school security officer, a campus security officer, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employee or contractor, whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for a public school, as defined in RCW 28A.150.010.**

    b. **"School** resource officer" means a commissioned law enforcement officer in the state of Washington with sworn authority to make arrests, deployed in community-oriented policing, and assigned by the employing police department or sheriff's office to work in schools to **build positive relationships with students and** address crime and disorder problems, gangs, and drug activities affecting or occurring in or around K-12 schools. School resource officers should focus on keeping students out of the criminal justice system when possible and should not be used to attempt to impose criminal sanctions in matters that are more appropriately handled within the educational system.


## Section 8
> This section modifies existing section [18.170.105](/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.170_security_guards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.170_security_guards.md) for context.

1. To promote the safety of persons and the security of property, the director shall meet with interested parties to develop lists of suggested preassignment, postassignment, and postassignment refresher training by rule.

2. All security guards licensed on or after July 1, 2005, must complete at least eight hours of preassignment training, comprised of at least four hours of classroom instruction and an additional four hours of classroom instruction or individual instruction, or both. The preassignment training may be waived for any individual who was most recently employed full time as a sworn peace officer not more than five years prior to applying to become licensed as a private security guard and who passes the examination typically administered to applicants at the conclusion of the preassignment training.

3. [Empty]

    a. All security guards licensed on or after July 1, 2005, must complete at least eight hours of initial postassignment training that shall be administered to each security guard. The initial postassignment training must be in the topic areas established by the director and may be classroom instruction or individual instruction, or both. A company may waive the initial postassignment training for security guards already licensed who transfer from another company, if the security guard presents appropriate training records signed by a department-certified trainer from the previous company, or a signed affidavit that the individual has already completed the required initial postassignment training provided by his or her previous company.

    b. Security guards who received their temporary security guard registration card on or before July 22, 2007, must receive their initial postassignment training before June 30, 2008. Security guards who received their temporary security guard registration card after July 22, 2007, must receive their initial postassignment training as specified in (c) and (d) of this subsection.

    c. Security guards licensed between January 1st and June 30th of any calendar year may receive eight hours of initial postassignment training any time between the day following the issuance of a temporary security guard registration card with their company and June 30th of the year following initial issuance of their license by the department.

    d. Security guards initially licensed between July 1st and December 31st of any calendar year may receive eight hours of initial postassignment training at any time between the day following the issuance of a temporary security guard registration card with their company and December 31st of the year following initial issuance of their license by the department.

4. Following completion of the preassignment and postassignment training, at least four total hours of annual refresher training shall be administered to security guards each subsequent year. The subsequent year begins, for refresher training purposes, the day following the last date the security guard is required to receive the eight hours of initial postassignment training. No more than one hour per year of annual refresher training may focus directly on customer service-related skills or topics and the remaining three hours per year of annual refresher training must focus on emergency response concepts, skills, or topics including but not limited to knowledge of site post orders or life safety.

5. **Security guards who receive any of the school safety and security staff classroom training described in section 4(2) of this act may apply the number of completed classroom training hours to meet either the initial postassignment training requirement or the annual refresher training requirement.**

6. Companies must maintain records regarding the training hours completed by each employee. All such records are subject to inspection by the department. The training requirements and test results must be recorded and attested to by a department-certified trainer. Training records must contain a description of the topics covered, the name and signature of the trainer, and the name and signature of the security guard.
