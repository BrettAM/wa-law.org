## Section 1
The legislature finds that many Washington property taxpayers are confused about precisely how those funds are spent by state and local governments. This confusion is caused, in many cases, by confusing language included on property tax statements, bills, and other related documents. So, the legislature intends to ease the confusion by requiring simplicity and clarity in property tax documents.
