<p>The legislature recognizes the number 988 as the universal telephone number within the United States to connect to the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system. The legislature has taken steps in accordance with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020 to improve acute mental health crisis outreach and stabilization services within Washington state. By July 1, 2024, the department of health must have in place the network of providers and have all of the new systems operational for when people located in Washington dial 988 for services.
This act provides for deployment of signs announcing the 988 hotline as part of new construction and replacement of public facilities with the intent to place the hotline information in locations that will be seen by people who are likely to use the hotline's services.</p>
