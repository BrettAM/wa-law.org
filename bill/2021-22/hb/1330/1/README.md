## Section 1
The legislature finds that encouraging citizens to own and use electric bicycles for commuting can replace light duty passenger vehicles and thus reduce congestion, local air pollution, and global carbon pollution while enhancing citizens' health and saving commuters money. The legislature recognizes that people with lower incomes have fewer financial resources for purchasing these types of vehicles, which can help them commute to work and school with reduced financial burdens. It is therefore the intent of this legislation to increase electric bicycle sales by providing an exemption from the state sales tax on new qualifying vehicle purchases.

## Section 2
(1) This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in sections 3 and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (sections 3 and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.
(2) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief for certain individuals as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).
(3) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage citizens to own and use electric bicycles by assisting in the purchasing of electric bicycles and related equipment.
(4) If a review finds that the number of electric bicycles purchased in Washington increases 25 percent as compared to the number of electric bicycles in calendar year 2020, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of this tax preference.
(5) In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.
