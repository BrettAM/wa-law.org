Any internet access service provider or seller of prepaid internet access service that appropriates or converts the tax collected to its own use or to any use other than the payment of the tax to the extent that the money collected is not available for payment on the due date as prescribed in this chapter is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
(2) If any internet access service provider or seller of prepaid internet access service fails to collect the excise tax imposed by this chapter or, after collecting the tax, fails to pay it to the department in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of its own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond its control, the company or seller is personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax, unless the company or seller has taken from the buyer in good faith documentation, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, stating that the buyer is not a subscriber or consumer or is otherwise not liable for the excise tax imposed by this chapter.
(3) The amount of tax, until paid by the subscriber to the internet access service provider, or to the department, or until paid by the consumer to the seller of prepaid internet access service, or to the department, constitutes a debt from the subscriber to the company, or from the consumer to the seller. Any company or seller that fails or refuses to collect the tax as required with intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or to gain some advantage or benefit, either direct or indirect, and any subscriber or consumer who refuses to pay any tax due under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor. The excise taxes required by this chapter to be collected by the internet access service provider must be stated separately on the billing statement that is sent to the subscriber.
(4) If a subscriber has failed to pay to the internet access service provider or a consumer has failed to pay to the seller of prepaid internet access service, the excise taxes imposed by this chapter and the company or seller has not paid the amount of the tax to the department, the department may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the subscriber or consumer for collection of the tax, in which case a penalty of 10 percent may be added to the amount of the tax for failure of the subscriber or consumer to pay the tax to the company or seller, regardless of when the tax is collected by the department. Tax under this chapter is due as provided under section 34 of this act.

## Section 33
(1) The department must administer and adopt rules as may be necessary to enforce and administer the excise taxes imposed by this chapter. Chapter 82.32 RCW, with the exception of RCW 82.32.045, 82.32.145, and 82.32.380, applies to the administration, collection, and enforcement of the excise taxes imposed by this chapter.
(2) The excise tax imposed by this chapter, along with reports and returns on forms prescribed by the department, are due at the same time the taxpayer reports other taxes under RCW 82.32.045. If no other taxes are reported under RCW 82.32.045, the taxpayer must remit the tax on an annual basis in accordance with RCW 82.32.045.
(3) The department may relieve any taxpayer or class of taxpayers from the obligation of remitting monthly and may require the return to cover other longer reporting periods, but in no event may returns be filed for a period greater than one year.
(4) The excise tax imposed by this chapter is in addition to any taxes imposed upon the same persons under chapters 82.08, 82.12, and 82.14 RCW.

## Section 34
(1) An internet access service provider company must file tax returns on a cash receipts or accrual basis according to which method of accounting is regularly employed in keeping the books of the company. A company filing returns on a cash receipts basis is not required to pay tax on debt subject to credit or refund under subsection (2) of this section.
(2) An internet access service provider company is entitled to a credit or refund for excise taxes imposed by this chapter previously paid on bad debts, as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 166, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003.

## Section 35
(1) Unless a seller or internet access service provider has taken from the buyer documentation, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, stating that the buyer is not a subscriber, consumer, or is otherwise not liable for the tax, the burden of proving that a sale of the use of internet access service was not a sale to a subscriber, consumer, or was not otherwise subject to the tax is upon the person who made the sale.
(2) If a seller or internet access service provider company does not receive documentation, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, stating that the buyer is not a subscriber, consumer, or is otherwise not liable for the tax at the time of the sale, have such documentation on file at the time of the sale, or obtain such documentation from the buyer within a reasonable time after the sale, the seller or internet access service provider company remains liable for the tax as provided in section 32 of this act, unless the seller or internet access service provider company can demonstrate facts and circumstances according to rules adopted by the department that show the sale was properly made without payment of the excise tax imposed by this chapter.
(3) The penalty imposed by RCW 82.32.291 may not be assessed on excise taxes imposed by this chapter due but not paid as a result of the improper use of documentation stating that the buyer is not a subscriber or consumer or is otherwise not liable for the excise tax imposed by this chapter. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

## Section 36
(1) Upon termination, dissolution, or abandonment of a corporate or limited liability company business, any officer, member, manager, or other person having control or supervision of excise tax funds collected and held in trust under section 32 of this act, or who is charged with the responsibility for the filing of returns or the payment of excise tax funds collected and held in trust under section 32 of this act, is personally liable for any unpaid taxes and interest and penalties on those taxes, if such officer or other person willfully fails to pay or to cause to be paid any excise taxes due from the corporation under this chapter. For the purposes of this section, any excise taxes imposed by this chapter that have been paid but not collected are deductible from the excise taxes imposed by this chapter collected but not paid. For purposes of this subsection "willfully fails to pay or to cause to be paid" means that the failure was the result of an intentional, conscious, and voluntary course of action.
(2) The officer, member, manager, or other person is liable only for taxes collected that became due during the period he or she had the control, supervision, responsibility, or duty to act for the corporation described in subsection (1) of this section, plus interest and penalties on those taxes.
(3) Persons liable under subsection (1) of this section are exempt from liability if nonpayment of the excise tax funds held in trust is due to reasons beyond their control as determined by the department by rule.
(4) Any person having been issued a notice of assessment under this section is entitled to the appeal procedures under RCW 82.32.160 through 82.32.200.
(5) This section applies only if the department has determined that there is no reasonable means of collecting the excise tax funds held in trust directly from the corporation.
(6) This section does not relieve the corporation or limited liability company of other tax liabilities or otherwise impair other tax collection remedies afforded by law.
(7) Collection authority and procedures prescribed in chapter 82.32 RCW apply to collections under this section.
