<p>v. An individual's moral character is determined by the individual's race or sex;</p>
<p>vi. An individual, by virtue of race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;</p>
<p>vii. Any individual should feel guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual's race or sex;</p>
<p>viii. Meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race; or</p>
