<p>f. Permits for industrial, business, or medical uses of alcohol; and</p>
<p>g. Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).</p>

<p>No order or orders  under subsection <strong>(1),</strong> (2)<strong>, or (3)</strong> of this section may continue for longer than <strong>30</strong> days unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the <strong>order or orders under this section</strong> may be extended in writing by <strong>unanimous agreement of</strong> the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives until the legislature can extend the <strong>order or orders</strong> by concurrent resolution. For purposes of this section, &quot;leadership of the senate and the house of representatives&quot; means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.</p>
</li>
