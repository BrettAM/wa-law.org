# House Bill 1499

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1499.xml)
## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that substance use disorder is among the only health conditions for which a person can be arrested for displaying symptoms. People use drugs to escape the painful reality of their lives and circumstances, including trauma that has never had a chance to heal. Causing more hurt through the trauma of incarceration will not produce a willingness to change, only more pain to numb. Arrest and incarceration do not treat the root causes of substance use disorder. Treating substance abuse disorder like a crime through arrests and incarceration further disrupts and destabilizes the lives of these individuals. Incarceration removes access to insurance and behavioral health services, places people with opioid use disorder at extraordinary risk of overdose upon release, and creates criminal records that erect long-term barriers to education, housing, and employment, all of which undermine efforts to achieve and maintain recovery. The diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder includes continued use despite negative consequences. Therefore, it is implausible that additional negative consequences will lead to a cessation of use.
(2) The legislature also finds that substance use disorder is a treatable brain disease from which people recover. Based on surveys conducted at syringe service programs, the vast majority of people who are using drugs want to reduce or stop their use. The barrier to these individuals engaging in treatment is not an absence of pain, but an absence of hope. When people in active substance use disorder are offered meaningful, person-centered support and interventions from a trusted source, such as a peer recovery coach, they are very likely to accept that support. If recovery support services, such as housing, education, employment pathways, community connection, and peer support are available during and after treatment, long-term, sustained recovery is not only possible, but probable.
(3) Therefore, the legislature intends to develop a robust system to provide rapid access to evidence-based and innovative substance use treatment and comprehensive recovery support services in lieu of criminal penalties for individuals in possession of drugs.

If the person is deceased, a member of the person's family or an official representative of the tribe of which the person was a member may apply to the court on behalf of the deceased person. Notwithstanding the requirements of RCW 9.94A.640, the court shall vacate the record of conviction if:

    a. The applicant is a member of a tribe that may exercise treaty Indian fishing rights at the location where the offense occurred; and

    b. The state has been enjoined from taking enforcement action of the statute or rule to the extent that it interferes with a treaty Indian fishing right as determined under , 384 F.

However, nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution.

    b. When a court vacates a record of domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020 under this section, the state may not use the vacated conviction in a later criminal prosecution unless the conviction was for: (i) Violating the provisions of a restraining order, no-contact order, or protection order restraining or enjoining the person or restraining the person from going on to the grounds of or entering a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location (RCW 10.99.040, 10.99.050, 26.09.300, 26.10.220, 26.26B.050, 26.44.063, 26.44.150, 26.50.060, 26.50.070, 26.50.130, 26.52.070, or 74.34.145); or (ii) stalking (RCW 9A.46.110). A vacated conviction under this section is not considered a conviction of such an offense for the purposes of 27 C.F.R. 478.11.

    c. A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 occurring on or after July 28, 2019.

7. The clerk of the court in which the vacation order is entered shall immediately transmit the order vacating the conviction to the Washington state patrol identification section and to the local police agency, if any, which holds criminal history information for the person who is the subject of the conviction. The Washington state patrol and any such local police agency shall immediately update their records to reflect the vacation of the conviction, and shall transmit the order vacating the conviction to the federal bureau of investigation. A conviction that has been vacated under this section may not be disseminated or disclosed by the state patrol or local law enforcement agency to any person, except other criminal justice enforcement agencies.


## Section 18
> This section modifies existing section [69.50.608](/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md) for context.

The state of Washington fully occupies and preempts the entire field of setting penalties for violations of the controlled substances act **and of establishing policies pertaining to personal use amounts as provided under section 5 of this act**. Cities, towns, and counties or other municipalities may enact only those laws and ordinances relating to controlled substances that are consistent with this chapter. Such local ordinances shall have the same penalties as provided for by state law. Local laws and ordinances that are inconsistent with the requirements of state law shall not be enacted and are preempted and repealed, regardless of the nature of the code, charter, or home rule status of the city, town, county, or municipality. **Nothing in this section shall be construed to inhibit local jurisdictions from creating additional channels for diversion to community-based care of individuals who commit law violations related to complex behavioral health needs, above those required by state law including in RCW 10.31.110.**


## Section 19
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
