<p>f. Removing the electric vehicle charging station if reasonably necessary for the repair, maintenance, or replacement of the common area or limited common area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an association of apartment owners reasonably determines that the cumulative use of electricity in the common interest community attributable to the installation and use of electric vehicle charging stations requires the installation of additional infrastructure improvements to provide the community with a sufficient supply of electricity, the association may assess the cost of the infrastructure improvements against each apartment owner that has, or will, install an electric vehicle charging station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An association of apartment owners may install an electric vehicle charging station in the common areas for the use of all apartment owners and, in that case, the association must develop appropriate terms of use for the charging station.</p>

<p>f. Comply with the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If installation of an electric vehicle charging station within the boundaries of a unit or in a designated parking space is impossible or unreasonably expensive, a unit owners association may authorize the installation of an electric vehicle charging station for the exclusive use of an owner in a common element that is not a limited common element designated for the use of that owner. In such cases, the association may enter into a license agreement with the owner for the use of the space in a common element, and the owner must comply with the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<p>a. A unit owner must obtain any permit or approval for an electric vehicle charging station as required by the local government in which the common interest community is located and comply with all relevant building codes and safety standards.</p>
<p>b. An electric vehicle charging station must meet all applicable health and safety standards and requirements imposed by national, state, or local authorities, and all other applicable zoning, land use or other ordinances, building codes, or land use permits.</p>

<p>a. Unless otherwise agreed to by written contract with the unit owners association, a unit owner is responsible for the costs of installing an electric vehicle charging station.</p>
<p>b. An electric vehicle charging station installed at the unit owner's cost is property of the unit owner. Upon sale of the unit, if the charging station is removable, the unit owner may either remove it or sell it to the buyer of the unit or to the association for an agreed price. Nothing in this subsection requires the buyer or the association to purchase the electric vehicle charging station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owner must disclose to any prospective buyers of the unit:</p>
<p>a. The existence of an electric vehicle charging station and the related responsibilities of the owner under this section; and</p>
<p>b. Whether the electric vehicle charging station is removable and whether the owner intends to remove the charging station in order to install it at the owner's new place of residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owner and each successive owner of an electric vehicle charging station is responsible for:</p>
<p>a. Costs for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the electric vehicle charging station up until the station is removed;</p>
<p>b. Costs for damage to the electric vehicle charging station, common element, or limited common element resulting from the installation, maintenance, repair, removal, or replacement of the electric vehicle charging station;</p>
<p>c. The cost of electricity associated with the electric vehicle charging station;</p>
<p>d. Obtaining and maintaining an insurance policy that meets the requirements in subsection (4)(c) of this section;</p>
<p>e. If the owner decides to remove the electric vehicle charging station, costs for the removal and the restoration of the common element or limited common element after the removal; and</p>
<p>f. Removing the electric vehicle charging station if reasonably necessary for the repair, maintenance, or replacement of the common element or limited common element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a unit owners association reasonably determines that the cumulative use of electricity in the common interest community attributable to the installation and use of electric vehicle charging stations requires the installation of additional infrastructure improvements to provide the community with a sufficient supply of electricity, the association may assess the cost of the infrastructure improvements against each unit owner that has, or will, install an electric vehicle charging station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owners association may install an electric vehicle charging station in the common elements for the use of all unit owners and, in that case, the association must develop appropriate terms of use for the charging station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owners association may create a new parking space where one did not previously exist to facilitate the installation of an electric vehicle charging station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<p>a. A unit owners association that willfully violates this section is liable to the unit owner for actual damages, and shall pay a civil penalty to the unit owner in an amount not to exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>b. In any action by a unit owner requesting to have an electric vehicle charging station installed and seeking to enforce compliance with this section, the court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to any prevailing unit owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>

<p>b. &quot;Electric vehicle charging station&quot; means a station that delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into one or more electric vehicles. An electric vehicle charging station may include several charge points simultaneously connecting several electric vehicles to the station and any related equipment needed to facilitate charging plug-in electric vehicles.</p>
<p>c. &quot;Reasonable restriction&quot; means a restriction that does not significantly increase the cost of an electric vehicle charging station or significantly decrease its efficiency or specified performance.</p>
