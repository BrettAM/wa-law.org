<h2 id="section-1-491">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-491">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the Washington innovates new personal protective equipment act (&quot;WIN PPE&quot;).</p>
<h2 id="section-2-338">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-338">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington has spent more than $300,000,000 on personal protective equipment in the first 10 months of the pandemic, almost exclusively purchased from overseas with significant delays and supply chain problems. The legislature further finds that there has been a strong desire for civic-minded Washington manufacturers to change production lines to produce personal protective equipment for the state and nation. The legislature finds that current purchasing preferences are in place in Washington for products with certain recycled content and other environmental attributes, but there is no purchasing preference to guide state procurement policy as it relates to personal protective equipment. Therefore, the legislature intends that the state take a more active role in creating awareness of the supply of high-quality and innovative personal protective equipment that is available to be purchased locally.</p>
<h2 id="section-8-143">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-143">¶</a></h2>
<p>The provisions of RCW 82.32.805 and 82.32.808 do not apply to this act.</p>
