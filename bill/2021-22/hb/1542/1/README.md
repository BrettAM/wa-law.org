## Section 1
The legislature finds that demographically diverse juries are essential to providing equal justice under law and providing defendants with a representative and impartial jury of peers. However, racial and ethnic minority populations are underrepresented in many jurisdictions' jury pools relative to their population within the jurisdiction. The 2019 jury diversity task force interim report recommends the state should continuously monitor juror demographics to track changes over time across the state so that programs designed to improve jury diversity can be evaluated. The legislature intends to implement the task force's recommendation by enacting this act.
