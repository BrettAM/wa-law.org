<p>The legislature finds that there continues to be a lack of access to behavioral health counseling and services for students on college campuses. The task force on community and technical college counselors found that there is variance throughout the community and technical college system in counseling models adopted, access to counselors, and general mental health resources available. The legislature intends to increase access to mental health counseling and services for students by establishing a pilot program to issue grants to community and technical colleges to implement strategies identified by the community and technical college counselors task force report.</p>
