<p>(1) Chapter 187, Laws of 2019 removed robbery in the second degree as a most serious offense in sentencing a person as a persistent offender. At that time, the legislature declined to require resentencing of individuals serving a life sentence as the result of a conviction for robbery in the second degree. The legislature recognizes the need to balance considerations that may have gone into the original charging decision and the inequities that may have resulted from including robbery in the second degree as a third strike offense.
(2) In exercising its duties under RCW 9.94A.885 and section 7 of this act, the clemency and pardons board shall give priority consideration to individuals who petition for conditional commutation and who have a current or past conviction for robbery in the second degree that was used as a basis for a finding that the individual was a persistent offender.
(3) This section expires December 31, 2024.</p>
