## Section 1
The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is an anomaly in world history. The strategies employed in an effort to protect Washington residents and businesses were informed by much information and disinformation. Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to declare a general amnesty for all civil penalties imposed on Washington residents and businesses for the violation of any activity, business activity, or conditions of operation for businesses, regulated under the emergency proclamations issued in direct response to the novel coronavirus COVID-19.
