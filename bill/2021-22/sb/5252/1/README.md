## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [28A.345.070](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.345_washington_state_school_directors_association.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.345_washington_state_school_directors_association.md) for context.

1. Beginning in **2022**, and at least once annually through **2026**, the Washington state school directors' association **shall** convene  meetings **regionally** and invite the tribal councils from the region for the purpose of establishing government-to-government relationships and dialogue between tribal councils and school district boards of directors. **Meetings may be conducted virtually if cost or other factors impact participants' ability to travel or meet in person.** Participants in these meetings should discuss issues of mutual concern, and should work to:

    a. Identify the extent and nature of the achievement gap and strategies necessary to close it;

    b. Increase mutual awareness and understanding of the importance of accurate, high-quality curriculum materials about the history, culture, and government of local tribes; and

    c. Encourage school boards to identify and adopt curriculum that includes tribal experiences and perspectives, so that Indian students are more engaged and learn more successfully, and so that all students learn about the history, culture, government, and experiences of their Indian peers and neighbors.

2. **Meetings held regionally must also include discussions of:**

    a. **Tribal consultation training and training requirements created under section 1 of this act;**

    b. **Identification of Native students, including federal identification guidelines for American Indian and Alaskan Native students;**

    c. **Data sharing between school districts and tribes; and**

    d. **Consultations between individual school boards and local tribes.**

3. By December 1, **2023**, and every two years thereafter through **2027**, the school directors' association shall report to the education committees of the legislature regarding the progress made in the development of effective government-to-government relations, the narrowing of the achievement gap, and the identification and adoption of curriculum regarding tribal history, culture, and government. The report shall include information about any obstacles encountered, and any strategies under development to overcome them.

4. **The school directors' association shall partner with the office of native education within the office of the superintendent of public instruction to gather data for the purposes of the report required in subsection (3) of this section.**
