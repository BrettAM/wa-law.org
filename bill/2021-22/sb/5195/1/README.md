## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington has made great strides in recent years to address the opioid crisis in our state. However, there continues to be too many deaths from opioid overdose in communities across the state. The use of opioid antagonists such as naloxone reverses the effects of opioids and can be lifesaving when an opioid overdose occurs.
The legislature intends to provide naloxone prescriptions to persons who present in an emergency department with an opioid overdose, along with a referral to services from a substance use disorder peer specialist. The legislature intends that this change will increase the number of opioid prescribed patients who have access to a lifesaving overdose intervention in the event of an emergency, with the goal of reducing the likelihood that an opioid overdose event for a given patient may lead to fatality or long-term adverse health outcomes and the likelihood of patients and their families will face long-term financial and emotional burdens due to an opioid overdose event.
