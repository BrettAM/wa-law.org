<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.070_department_of_health.html">43.70.615</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.070_department_of_health.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;multicultural health&quot; means the provision of health care services with the knowledge and awareness of the causes and effects of the determinants of health that lead to disparities in health status between different genders and racial and ethnic populations and the practice skills necessary to respond appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with the disciplining authorities as defined in RCW 18.130.040, shall establish, within available department general funds, an ongoing multicultural health awareness and education program as an integral part of its health professions regulation. The purpose of the education program is to raise awareness and educate health care professionals regarding the knowledge, attitudes, and practice skills necessary to care for diverse populations to achieve a greater understanding of the relationship between culture and health.  Any such education shall be developed in collaboration with education programs that train students in that health profession.  No funds from the health professions account may be utilized to fund activities under this section unless the disciplining authority authorizes expenditures from its proportions of the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2008, each education program with a curriculum to train health professionals for employment in a profession credentialed by a disciplining authority under chapter 18.130 RCW shall integrate into the curriculum instruction in multicultural health as part of its basic education preparation curriculum. The department may not deny the application of any applicant for a credential to practice a health profession on the basis that the education or training program that the applicant successfully completed did not include integrated multicultural health curriculum as part of its basic instruction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
