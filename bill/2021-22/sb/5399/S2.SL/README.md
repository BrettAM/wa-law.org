## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that:
(a) Healthy Washingtonians contribute to the economic well-being of their families and communities, and access to appropriate health services and improved health outcomes allow all Washingtonian families to enjoy productive and satisfying lives;
(b) Washington and the United States are experiencing the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression, caused by a public health crisis;
(c) Skyrocketing unemployment rates due to COVID-19 have exposed the frailties and inequalities of the current health care system while causing unsustainable strain to the state's medicaid system;
(d) Thousands of union and nonunion workers are unemployed and without health insurance;
(e) Approximately 125,000 undocumented people live in the state with no access to health care during a global pandemic;
(f) Multiple economic analyses show that a universal system is less expensive, more equitable, and will produce billions in savings per year; and
(g) While a unified health care financing system can provide universal coverage, increase access to care, decrease costs, and improve quality, implementing such a system in the state is dependent on foundational legal, financial, and programmatic changes from the federal government.
(2) The legislature intends to create a permanent universal health care commission to:
(a) Implement immediate and impactful changes in the state's current health care system to increase access to quality, affordable health care by streamlining access to coverage, reducing fragmentation of health care financing across multiple public and private health insurance entities, reducing unnecessary administrative costs, reducing health disparities, and establishing mechanisms to expeditiously link residents with their chosen providers; and
(b) Establish the preliminary infrastructure to create a universal health system, including a unified financing system, that controls health care spending so that the system is affordable to the state, employers, and individuals, once the necessary federal authorities have been realized.
(3) The legislature further intends that the state, in collaboration with all communities, health plans, and providers, should take steps to improve health outcomes for all residents of the state.
