<p>The legislature finds that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our state and the world today, an existential crisis with major negative impacts on environmental and human health. The legislature further finds that compact and responsibly planned development of residential and public facilities, intended under the growth management act, mitigates climate change through the efficient use of energy resources and the corresponding decrease in greenhouse gas production. This dense development and the concentration of growth in urban areas also prevents sprawl, lessening development's impact on natural resources, ecosystems, and habitats.
The legislature also finds that current legal frameworks work against the act's goal of responsibly planned for growth by prematurely allowing development rights to vest before the validity of plans and regulations can be determined. This flawed process has led to the approval of development that has decreased resource lands and placed a strain on local infrastructure services. Furthermore, it makes it extremely difficult for local jurisdictions to come back into compliance with state laws and leaves citizens with no real remedy to undo these planning violations.
Therefore, the legislature intends to set the effective date of these impactful planning actions to a time that will allow for the thorough review of growth planning decisions intended under the act.</p>
