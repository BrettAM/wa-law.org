## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [70.14.060](/rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.014_health_care_services_purchased_by_state_agencies.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.014_health_care_services_purchased_by_state_agencies.md) for context.

1. [Empty]

    a. The **director** of the state health care authority shall, directly or by contract, adopt policies necessary for establishment of a prescription drug purchasing consortium. The consortium's purchasing activities shall be based upon the evidence-based prescription drug program established under RCW 70.14.050. **Except as provided in section 1 of this act or exempted under (b) of this subsection, state** purchased health care programs as defined in RCW 41.05.011 shall purchase prescription drugs through the consortium for those prescription drugs that are purchased directly by the state and those that are purchased through reimbursement of pharmacies. The **director** shall not require any supplemental rebate offered to the health care authority by a pharmaceutical manufacturer for prescription drugs purchased for medical assistance program clients under chapter 74.09 RCW be extended to any other state purchased health care program, or to any other individuals or entities participating in the consortium. The **director** shall explore joint purchasing opportunities with other states.

    b. State purchased health care programs are exempt from the requirements of this section if they can demonstrate to the **director** of the state health care authority that, as a result of the availability of federal programs or other purchasing arrangements, their other purchasing mechanisms will result in greater discounts and aggregate cost savings than would be realized through participation in the consortium.

2. Participation in the purchasing consortium shall be offered as an option beginning January 1, 2006. Participation in the consortium is purely voluntary for units of local government, private entities, labor organizations, health carriers as provided in RCW 48.43.005, state purchased health care services from or through health carriers as provided in RCW 48.43.005, and for individuals who lack or are underinsured for prescription drug coverage. The **director** may set reasonable fees, including enrollment fees, to cover administrative costs attributable to participation in the prescription drug consortium.

3. The state health care authority is authorized to adopt rules implementing chapter 129, Laws of 2005.


## Section 3
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
