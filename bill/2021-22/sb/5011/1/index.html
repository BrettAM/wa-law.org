<li>
<p><strong>Unit owners may vote at a meeting in person, by absentee ballot pursuant to subsection (3)(d) of this section, or by a proxy pursuant to subsection (5) of this section.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a vote is conducted without a meeting, unit owners may vote by ballot pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>At a meeting of unit owners the following requirements apply:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>Unit owners or their proxies who are present in person may vote by voice vote, show of hands, standing, written ballot, or any other method for determining the votes of unit owners, as designated by the person presiding at the meeting.</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>If only one of several unit owners of a unit is present, that unit owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that unit. If more than one of the unit owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the unit owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is a majority agreement if any one of the unit owners casts the votes allocated to the unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other unit owners of the unit.</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>Unless a greater number or fraction of the votes in the association is required under this chapter or the declaration or organizational documents, a majority of the votes cast determines the outcome of any action of the association.</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>Whenever proposals or board members are to be voted upon at a meeting, a unit owner may vote by duly executed absentee ballot if:</strong></p>
<pre><code> i. **The name of each candidate and the text of each proposal to be voted upon are set forth in a writing accompanying or contained in the notice of meeting; and**

 ii. **A ballot is provided by the association for such purpose.**
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a unit owner votes by absentee ballot, the association must be able to verify that the ballot is cast by the unit owner having the right to do so.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Except as provided otherwise in the declaration or organizational documents, the following requirements apply with respect to proxy voting:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a directed or undirected proxy duly executed by a unit owner in the same manner as provided in RCW 24.06.110.</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>If a unit is owned by more than one person, each unit owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other unit owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>A unit owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of revocation to the secretary or the person presiding over a meeting of the association or by delivery of a subsequent proxy. The death or disability of a unit owner does not revoke a proxy given by the unit owner unless the person presiding over the meeting has actual notice of the death or disability.</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>Unless stated otherwise in the proxy, a proxy terminates eleven months after its date of issuance.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unless prohibited or limited by the declaration or organizational documents, an association may conduct a vote without a meeting. In that event, the following requirements apply:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>The association must notify the unit owners that the vote will be taken by ballot.</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>The notice must state:</strong></p>
<pre><code> i. **The time and date by which a ballot must be delivered to the association to be counted, which may not be fewer than fourteen days after the date of the notice, and which deadline may be extended in accordance with (g) of this subsection;**

 ii. **The percent of votes necessary to meet the quorum requirements;**

 iii. **The percent of votes necessary to approve each matter other than election of board members; and**

 iv. **The time, date, and manner by which unit owners wishing to deliver information to all unit owners regarding the subject of the vote may do so.**
</code></pre>
<p>c. <strong>The association must deliver a ballot to every unit owner with the notice.</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>The ballot must set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to vote for or against the action.</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>A ballot cast pursuant to this section may be revoked only by actual notice to the association of revocation. The death or disability of a unit owner does not revoke a ballot unless the association has actual notice of the death or disability prior to the date set forth in (b)(i) of this subsection.</strong></p>
<p>f. <strong>Approval by ballot pursuant to this subsection is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action.</strong></p>
<p>g. <strong>If the association does not receive a sufficient number of votes to constitute a quorum or to approve the proposal by the date and time established for return of ballots, the board of directors may extend the deadline for a reasonable period not to exceed eleven months upon further notice to all members in accordance with (b) of this subsection. In that event, all votes previously cast on the proposal must be counted unless subsequently revoked as provided in this section.</strong></p>
<p>h. <strong>A ballot or revocation is not effective until received by the association.</strong></p>
<p>i. <strong>The association must give notice to unit owners of any action taken pursuant to this subsection within a reasonable time after the action is taken.</strong></p>
<p>j. <strong>When an action is taken pursuant to this subsection, a record of the action, including the ballots or a report of the persons appointed to tabulate such ballots, must be kept with the minutes of meetings of the association.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the governing documents require that votes on specified matters affecting the common interest community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>This section applies to lessees as if they were unit owners;</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>Unit owners that have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters; and</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unit owners must also be given notice, in the manner provided in section 8 of this act, of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In any vote of the unit owners, votes allocated to a unit owned by the association must be cast in the same proportion as the votes cast on the matter by unit owners other than the association.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:</p>
<p>a. Property insurance on the condominium, which may, but need not, include equipment, improvements, and betterments in a unit installed by the declarant or the unit owners, insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than eighty percent, or such greater amount specified in the declaration, of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies; and</p>
<p>b. Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the board of directors but not less than the amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the insurance described in subsection (1) of this section is not reasonably available, or is modified, canceled, or not renewed, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be <strong>provided to each unit owner in accordance with this chapter,</strong> to all unit owners, to each eligible mortgagee, and to each mortgagee to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall provide that:</p>
<p>a. Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the owner's interest in the common elements or membership in the association;</p>
<p>b. The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner, member of the owner's household, and lessee of the owner;</p>
<p>c. No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of the owner's authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and</p>
<p>d. If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any loss covered by the property insurance under subsection (1)(a) of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a mortgage. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the condominium is terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit owner or holder of a mortgage. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to the cancellation or nonrenewal of contracts of insurance. The insurer shall not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy, or cancel or refuse to renew the policy without complying with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any portion of the condominium for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (a) The condominium is terminated; (b) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (c) eighty percent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If all of the damaged or destroyed portions of the condominium are not repaired or replaced: (i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium; (ii) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and (iii) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under RCW 64.34.060(1), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, RCW 64.34.268 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section may be varied or waived as provided in the declaration if all units of a condominium are restricted to nonresidential use.</p>

The motion shall state specifically the purpose for the closed session. Reference to the motion and the stated purpose for the closed session shall be included in the minutes.
