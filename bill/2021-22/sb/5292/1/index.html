<h2 id="section-1-1245">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1245">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature finds that one of the best and most cost-effective ways for the residents of Washington state to achieve physical and mental health, and to prevent costly diseases and conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and other coronary conditions is to get regular exercise and physical activity. In fact, as part of a study done for the recreation and conservation office on the benefits of trail-based activities, the University of Washington conducted a literature review of over 100 studies that identify evidence of a close linkage between health benefits and being outdoors. The literature review further found that the health benefits of nature &quot;may be particularly impactful for the 12.2 percent who have incomes below the poverty level.&quot;
(2) The legislature further finds that for all residents, public parks and trails, recreation programs, and open spaces offer equitable, no-cost, or low-cost options for all people to be active and healthy, with these spaces receiving record levels of use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
(3) The legislature finds that it can harness the equitable and low-cost or no-cost opportunities provided by parks and recreation spaces, and build upon successful programs established in areas such as the East Bay of California and the state of Tennessee, by establishing a pilot program in Washington state through which parks and recreation officials, health care providers, public and community health advocates, and insurance company representatives can work collaboratively to design a program that will incentivize residents, particularly those from communities experiencing inequities or without ready access to physical fitness facilities, to regularly use public parks and recreation sites, facilities and programs to enable better physical and mental health outcomes, decrease visits to hospitals and clinics, and lower overall insurance costs.
(4) It is the legislature's intent to establish a task force to work on designing a pilot program that can be implemented in the Puget Sound area, in eastern Washington, and in southwest Washington.</p>
