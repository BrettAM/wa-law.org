# Senate Bill 5250

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5250.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that Washington voters support initiatives in order to propose and enact laws or reject laws at an election independent of the legislature. The legislature also recognizes that informed public discussion and the exercise of the initiative power will be enhanced by an independent panel of voters who will report to the electorate on initiatives in the voters' pamphlet. Citizen initiative review panels established in other states have proven to be a useful tool for voters to gain important objective information about initiatives and increase public confidence in both the initiative process and their understanding of the proposed measures. Therefore, the legislature proposes to establish a pilot program for a citizens' review of initiatives for 2022.

## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [29A.32.070](/rcw/29A_elections/29A.32_voters_pamphlets.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/29A_elections/29A.32_voters_pamphlets.md) for context.

The secretary of state shall determine the format and layout of the voters' pamphlet published under RCW 29A.32.010. The secretary of state shall print the pamphlet in clear, readable type on a size, quality, and weight of paper that in the judgment of the secretary of state best serves the voters. The pamphlet must contain a table of contents. Measures and arguments must be printed in the order specified by RCW 29A.72.290.

The secretary of state's name may not appear in the voters' pamphlet in his or her official capacity if the secretary is a candidate for office during the same year. His or her name may only be included as part of the information normally included for candidates.

The voters' pamphlet must provide the following information for each statewide issue on the ballot except measures for an advisory vote of the people whose requirements are provided in subsection (12) of this section:

1. The legal identification of the measure by serial designation or number;

2. The official ballot title of the measure;

5. The fiscal impact statement prepared under RCW 29A.72.025;

6. **The statements submitted by the citizens' initiative review panels pursuant to section 4 of this act;**

7. The total number of votes cast for and against the measure in the senate and house of representatives, if the measure has been passed by the legislature;

8. An argument advocating the voters' approval of the measure together with any statement in rebuttal of the opposing argument;

9. An argument advocating the voters' rejection of the measure together with any statement in rebuttal of the opposing argument;

10. Each argument or rebuttal statement must be followed by the names of the committee members who submitted them, and may be followed by a telephone number that citizens may call to obtain information on the ballot measure;

11. The full text of the measure;

12. Two pages shall be provided in the general election voters' pamphlet for each measure for an advisory vote of the people under RCW 43.135.041 and shall consist of the serial number assigned by the secretary of state under RCW 29A.72.040, the short description formulated by the attorney general under RCW 29A.72.283, the tax increase's most up‑to‑date ten‑year cost projection, including a year‑by‑year breakdown, by the office of financial management under RCW 43.135.031, and the names of the legislators, and their contact information, and how they voted on the increase upon final passage so they can provide information to, and answer questions from, the public. For the purposes of this subsection, "names of legislators, and their contact information" includes each legislator's position (senator or representative), first name, last name, party affiliation (for example, Democrat or Republican), city or town they live in, office phone number, and office email address.


## Section 6
After the 2022 general election, the Washington state institute for public policy shall contract for an evaluation of the effectiveness of the citizens' initiative review process. The results of the evaluation must be reported to the appropriate committees of the legislature. To the extent practicable, the institute shall seek a pro bono evaluation by a well-qualified organization. The evaluation must determine the effectiveness of the pilot citizens' initiative review process as defined by the criteria used in previous evaluations funded by the national science foundation.
