<p>(1) To provide clarity and certainty to stakeholders on the details of performance-based regulation, the utilities and transportation commission is directed to conduct a proceeding to develop a policy statement addressing alternatives to traditional cost of service rate making, including performance measures or goals, targets, performance incentives, and penalty mechanisms. As part of such a proceeding, the utilities and transportation commission must consider factors including, but not limited to, lowest reasonable cost planning, affordability, increases in energy burden, cost of service, customer satisfaction and engagement, service reliability, clean energy or renewable procurement, conservation acquisition, demand side management expansion, rate stability, timely execution of competitive procurement practices, attainment of state energy and emissions reduction policies, rapid integration of renewable energy resources, and fair compensation of utility employees.
(2) In developing its policy statement, the utilities and transportation commission must in its proceeding allow for participation and consultation with regulated utilities, the attorney general's office, and other interested stakeholders including, but not limited to, residential, industrial, commercial, and low-income customers and organizations, as well as environmental or community organizations and stakeholders.
(3) By January 1, 2022, the utilities and transportation commission shall notify the chairs and ranking members of the appropriate committees of the legislature of the process to date, the expected duration of, and work plan associated with this proceeding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/80_public_utilities/80.28_gas_electrical_and_water_companies.html">80.28.068</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/80_public_utilities/80.28_gas_electrical_and_water_companies.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Upon its own motion, or upon</strong> request by an electrical or gas company, or other party to a general rate case hearing, <strong>or other proceeding to set rates,</strong> the commission may approve rates, charges, services, and/or physical facilities at a discount**, or through grants,** for low-income senior customers and low-income customers. Expenses and lost revenues as a result of these discounts <strong>or grants</strong> shall be included in the company's cost of service and recovered in rates to other customers. <strong>The gas or electrical company must use reasonable and good faith efforts to seek approval for low-income program design, eligibility, operation, outreach, and funding proposals from its low-income and equity advisory groups in advance of filing such proposals with the commission. In order to remove barriers and to expedite assistance, low-income discounts or grants approved under this section must be provided in coordination with community-based organizations in the gas or electrical company's service territory including, but not limited to, grantees of the department of commerce, community action agencies, and community-based nonprofit organizations. Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the commission's authority to approve or modify tariffs authorizing low-income discounts or grants.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eligibility for a low-income discount rate or grant established in this section may be established upon verification of a low-income customer's receipt of any means-tested public benefit, or verification of eligibility for the low-income home energy assistance program, or its successor program, for which eligibility does not exceed the low-income definition set by the commission pursuant to RCW 19.405.020. The public benefits may include, but are not limited to, assistance that provides cash, housing, food, or medical care including, but not limited to, temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, emergency assistance to elders, disabled, and children, supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, public housing, federally subsidized or state-subsidized housing, the low-income home energy assistance program, veterans' benefits, and similar benefits.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each gas or electrical company shall conduct substantial outreach efforts to make the low-income discounts or grants available to eligible customers and must provide annual reports to the commission as to the gas or electrical company's outreach activities and results. Such outreach: (a) Shall be made at least semiannually to inform customers of available rebates, discounts, credits, and other cost-saving mechanisms that can help them lower their monthly bills for gas or electrical service; and (b) may be in the form of any customary and usual methods of communication or distribution including, without limitation, widely broadcast communications with customers, direct mailing, telephone calls, electronic communications, social media postings, in-person contacts, websites of the gas or electrical company, press releases, and print and electronic media, that are designed to increase access to and participation in bill assistance programs.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outreach may include establishing an automated program of matching customer accounts with lists of recipients of the means-tested public benefit programs and, based on the results of the matching program, to presumptively offer a low-income discount rate or grant to eligible customers so identified. However, the gas or electrical company must within 60 days of the presumptive enrollment inform such a low-income customer of the presumptive enrollment and all rights and obligations of a customer under the program, including the right to withdraw from the program without penalty.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A residential customer eligible for a low-income discount rate must receive the service on demand.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A residential customer may not be charged for initiating or terminating low-income discount rates, grants, or any other form of energy assistance.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>&quot;Energy burden&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.405.020.</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>&quot;Low-income&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.405.020.</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>&quot;Physical facilities&quot; includes, but may not be limited to, a community solar project as defined in RCW 80.28.370.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5-637">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-637">¶</a></h2>
<p>If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.</p>
