<h2 id="section-1-1568">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1568">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature finds that gas and electrical companies face transformational change brought on by new technology, rapidly changing costs, emerging opportunities for customers, and public policy mandates. Policy mandates, such as chapter 19.405 RCW, the clean energy transformation act, mean these companies must find innovative and creative solutions to equitably serve their customers.
(2) The legislature finds that the traditional regulatory construct is neither adaptable, nor well suited to adjusting to rapidly changing societal expectations and public policy objectives, and therefore hinders the ability of gas and electrical companies to effectively evolve to meet new challenges and opportunities.
(3) In particular, the legislature finds that traditional cost of service regulation may lead to a significant delay in recovery of costs for gas and electrical companies. This regulatory lag creates barriers to companies making the investments necessary to meet public policy objectives and expectations. The traditional regulatory process results in a backward-looking annual cycle of rate cases that may limit the ability of gas and electrical companies and customers in achieving the state's energy policy goals.
(4) It is the intent of the legislature that the regulatory construct should require a forward-looking orientation for regulation consistent with state policy objectives that focus on planning, flexibility, and fair allocation of risks, while fostering and supporting a culture that delivers performance and cost control in this new industry environment.
(5) It is the intent of the legislature that the regulation of gas and electrical companies transform toward multiyear rate plans and performance-based rate making to provide certainty and stability to customers and gas and electrical companies, with those plans focused on ensuring alignment of public policy objectives, investment, safety, and reliability.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon request by an electrical or gas company, or other party to a general rate case hearing, the commission may approve rates, charges, services, and/or physical facilities at a discount for low-income senior customers and low-income customers. Expenses and lost revenues as a result of these discounts shall be included in the company's cost of service and recovered in rates to other customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An electrical company may provide discounts under this section to reduce the energy burden of low-income or vulnerable populations and to ensure that the benefits of the transition to clean energy are equitably distributed, as required under chapter 19.405 RCW.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eligibility for the discount rates established in this section must be established upon verification of a low-income customer's receipt of any means tested public benefit, or verification of eligibility for the low-income home energy assistance program, or its successor program, for which eligibility does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level based on a household's gross income. The public benefits may include, but are not limited to, assistance that provides cash, housing, food, or medical care including, but not limited to, temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, emergency assistance to elders, disabled, and children, supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, public housing, federally subsidized or state-subsidized housing, the low-income home energy assistance program, veterans' benefits, and similar benefits. Each gas or electrical company shall conduct substantial outreach efforts to make the low-income discount available to eligible customers and must provide annual reports to the commission as to the gas or electrical company's outreach activities and results. Outreach may include establishing an automated program of matching customer accounts with lists of recipients of the means tested public benefit programs and, based on the results of the matching program, to presumptively offer a low-income discount rate to eligible customers so identified. However, the gas or electrical company must within 60 days of the presumptive enrollment inform such a low-income customer of the  presumptive enrollment and all rights and obligations of a customer under the program, including the right to withdraw from the program without penalty.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A residential customer eligible for a low-income discount rate must receive the service on demand. Each gas or electrical company shall periodically notify all customers of the availability and method of obtaining low-income discount rates.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The commission shall adopt rules requiring gas or electrical companies to produce information, in the form of a mailing, electronic distribution, or other customary and usual method of distribution, to their customers, to inform them of available rebates, discounts, credits, and other cost-saving mechanisms that can help the customers to lower their monthly bills for gas or electrical service, and send out the information semiannually, unless otherwise provided by this chapter.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<p>a. <strong>A residential customer may not be charged for initiating or terminating low-income discount rates when the initiation or termination request is made after a regular meter reading has occurred and the customer is in receipt of the results of the reading.</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>A gas or electrical company may impose a reasonable charge, as set by the commission through regulation, for initiating or terminating low-income discount rates when a customer does not make such an initiation or termination request upon the receipt of the results and prior to the receipt of the next regularly scheduled meter reading.</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>Notwithstanding (b) of this subsection, a residential customer may not be charged when the initiation or termination is involuntary on the part of the customer.</strong></p>
