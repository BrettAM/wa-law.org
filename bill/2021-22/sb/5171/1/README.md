# Senate Bill 5171

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state unemployment insurance trust fund has been greatly depleted by an unprecedented number of claims stemming from pandemic-related job losses. The legislature also finds that replenishing the fund through increased unemployment insurance contributions would cause additional financial harm to many Washington employers and employees as they work to recover fully from the pandemic and government-mandated closures.
It is therefore the intent of the legislature to replenish the unemployment insurance trust fund in 2021-22 with revenue from the budget stabilization account, recognizing that a significant amount of revenue in that account originated with Washington employers through their payment of other taxes. This would be fiscally prudent and protect employers and employees at a critical time in our state's economic history. Should additional pandemic relief be received from the federal government in 2021, the legislature intends that it should be used first to replace revenue appropriated from the budget stabilization account to replenish the unemployment insurance trust fund.

## Section 2
The purposes of this act are to provide unemployment insurance contribution relief to employers, including immediate relief in calendar year 2021 and enacting reforms to lessen the need for higher contributions in future years. The relief should include both social and experience rating contribution reductions, and focus should be given to particularly hard-hit employers in the pandemic, especially those who suffered government-mandated closures.

## Section 4
The sum of $1,000,000,000 is appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, from the budget stabilization account to the unemployment insurance relief account for the purposes of this act as provided in section 2 of this act.

## Section 5
If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state or the eligibility of employers in this state for federal unemployment tax credits, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict, and the finding or determination does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state or the granting of federal unemployment tax credits to employers in this state.
