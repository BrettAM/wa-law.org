## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today's world and will be a vital component of a diverse and robust economy moving forward.
(2) All public schools are required to fulfill the requirements in RCW 28A.230.300, which requires that every high school offer an elective computer science course by the 2022-23 school year. A significant shortage of computer science teachers remains, and schools are at risk of not providing these courses going forward. Only 48 percent of public high schools across Washington teach computer science. Without teachers who are certified or hold specialty endorsements in computer science, it will be difficult to deliver computer science classes that are effective, engaging, and equitably taught to diverse students across our state.
