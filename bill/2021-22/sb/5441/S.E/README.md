## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that every person undergoing breast implant surgery should be provided complete information about potential risks, symptoms, and complications involved before the surgery.
(2) A survey of over 5,000 individuals who received breast implants found that 84 percent believed they were not given enough time and information to make an informed decision about the breast implant surgery.
(3) In October 2019, the food and drug administration recommended a warning label on all breast implants.
(4) Therefore, the legislature intends to require physicians to provide patients with a checklist of information and receive informed consent to empower patients to make their own choices when it comes to any risks involved in a breast implant surgery.
