<h2 id="section-1-1526">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1526">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature finds that:
(a) The delivery of health care services is essential and maintaining patient safety during the ongoing public health emergency is paramount;
(b) Pursuant to state and federal regulations, and in the interest of minimizing the risk of viral transmission, health care providers have incurred substantially increased costs during the public health emergency associated with the procurement of personal protective equipment;
(c) Costs associated with providing care are typically factored into contracts between a health carrier and a health care provider, but the dramatically increased personal protective equipment costs related to the pandemic, in terms of procurement and increased &quot;per unit&quot; costs, were neither foreseeable nor contemplated in existing contracts; and
(d) Health care providers do not want to bill patients directly for costs associated with personal protective equipment, and in many cases are precluded from doing so pursuant to terms of contract between health care providers and health carriers, so many health care providers currently do not have a mechanism to recoup costs of personal protective equipment.
(2) Therefore, the legislature finds that to help ensure patient safety and continued access to personal protective equipment, it is necessary that health carriers reimburse health care providers for costs associated with personal protective equipment.</p>
