# Senate Bill 5413

## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the "Solitary Confinement Restriction Act."

## Section 2
The Legislature finds and declares that:
(1) The use of solitary confinement in Washington state's correctional facilities should be restricted to ensure the safe and humane operation of these facilities, consistent with the state and federal Constitution, the laws and public policies of this state, the mission of the correctional system, evolving medical knowledge, and the human rights standards of decency.
(2) Solitary confinement should only be used when necessary, and should not be used against vulnerable populations or under conditions or for time periods that foster psychological trauma, psychiatric disorders, or serious, long-term damage to a person's brain.
(3) The standards established in this act should apply to all incarcerated persons in the custody of the department of corrections.
(4) In 2020, the Washington state attorney general's office proposed legislation to ban the use of solitary confinement for juveniles; the bill passed with bipartisan support.
(5) More than 800 adults continue to be held in solitary confinement in Washington's prisons; solitary confinement is disproportionately imposed upon Black, indigenous, and Hispanic people in the state's prisons.
(6) In addition to the devastating and lasting psychological consequences of solitary confinement, recent studies have shown that people in these restrictive settings also have higher rates of medical concerns and have a shorter life expectancy once released to the community. Studies have also shown that people released to the community directly from solitary confinement also have higher recidivism rates.
