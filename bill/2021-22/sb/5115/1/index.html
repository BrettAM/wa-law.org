(d) A whistleblower action must be commenced within the same period of time that the department would have to take action based on the same set of alleged facts. The statute of limitations for bringing a whistleblower action is tolled from the date a relator files a notice with the department or the date the department commences an investigation.
(e) The requirements of Rule 23 of the superior court rules of civil procedure do not apply to a whistleblower action brought under this section.
(f) The right to bring a whistleblower action under this section may not be impaired by any private agreement.

(3)(a) The department may intervene in a whistleblower action and proceed with any and all claims in the action:
(i) As of right within 30 days after the filing of the whistleblower action;

(b) If the department intervenes in a whistleblower action, the department shall have primary responsibility for litigating the action and shall not be bound by an act of the relator in bringing the action.

The department may dismiss or settle the action if the court determines that the dismissal or settlement is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest.
(c) If the department does not intervene, the relator shall have the right to litigate the action. The court must review and approve any settlement. The proposed settlement must be submitted to the department at the same time that it is submitted to the court, and the agency may present to the court its position on the proposed settlement or intervene as provided in (a) of this subsection. The court shall approve a settlement only upon a determination that it is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest.
(d) Any settlement of a whistleblower action may not be confidential.
(4)(a) Penalty amounts recovered in a whistleblower action must be distributed as follows:
(i) If the department has not intervened, 40 percent to the relator and 60 percent to the agency;
(ii) If the department has intervened, 20 percent to the relator and 80 percent to the agency.
(b) Amounts distributed to the department shall be used for enforcement of chapter 49.17 RCW and education about the rights and obligations enforceable through this section by the agency.

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.html">49.46.210</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Except</strong> as provided in RCW 49.46.180, every employer shall provide each of its employees paid sick leave as follows:</p>
<p>a. An employee shall accrue at least one hour of paid sick leave for every <strong>40</strong> hours worked as an employee. An employer may provide paid sick leave in advance of accrual provided that such front-loading meets or exceeds the requirements of this section for accrual, use, and carryover of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>b. An employee is authorized to use paid sick leave for the following reasons:</p>
<pre><code> i. An absence resulting from an employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; to accommodate the employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or an employee's need for preventive medical care;

 ii. To allow the employee to provide care for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or care for a family member who needs preventive medical care; and

 iii. When the employee's place of business has been closed by order of a public official for any health-related reason, or when an employee's child's school or place of care has been closed for such a reason.
</code></pre>
<p>c. An employee is authorized to use paid sick leave for absences that qualify for leave under the domestic violence leave act, chapter 49.76 RCW.</p>
<p>d. An employee is entitled to use accrued paid sick leave beginning on the <strong>90th</strong> calendar day after the commencement of his or her employment.</p>
<p>e. Employers are not prevented from providing more generous paid sick leave policies or permitting use of paid sick leave for additional purposes.</p>
<p>f. An employer may require employees to give reasonable notice of an absence from work, so long as such notice does not interfere with an employee's lawful use of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>g. For absences exceeding three days, an employer may require verification that an employee's use of paid sick leave is for an authorized purpose. If an employer requires verification, verification must be provided to the employer within a reasonable time period during or after the leave. An employer's requirements for verification may not result in an unreasonable burden or expense on the employee and may not exceed privacy or verification requirements otherwise established by law.</p>
<p>h. An employer may not require, as a condition of an employee taking paid sick leave, that the employee search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is on paid sick leave.</p>
<p>i. For each hour of paid sick leave used, an employee shall be paid the greater of the minimum hourly wage rate established in this chapter or his or her normal hourly compensation. The employer is responsible for providing regular notification to employees about the amount of paid sick leave available to the employee.</p>
<p>j. Unused paid sick leave carries over to the following year, except that an employer is not required to allow an employee to carry over paid sick leave in excess of <strong>40</strong> hours.</p>
<p>k. This section does not require an employer to provide financial or other reimbursement for accrued and unused paid sick leave to any employee upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within <strong>12</strong> months of separation by the same employer, whether at the same or a different business location of the employer, previously accrued unused paid sick leave shall be reinstated and the previous period of employment shall be counted for purposes of determining the employee's eligibility to use paid sick leave under subsection (1)(d) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;family member&quot; means any of the following:</p>
<p>a. A child, including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis, is a legal guardian, or is a de facto parent, regardless of age or dependency status;</p>
<p>b. A biological, adoptive, de facto, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an employee or the employee's spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child;</p>
<p>c. A spouse;</p>
<p>d. A registered domestic partner;</p>
<p>e. A grandparent;</p>
<p>f. A grandchild; or</p>
<p>g. A sibling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer may not adopt or enforce any policy that counts the use of paid sick leave time as an absence that may lead to or result in discipline against the employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer may not discriminate or retaliate against an employee for his or her exercise of any rights under this chapter including the use of paid sick leave.</p>
</li>
