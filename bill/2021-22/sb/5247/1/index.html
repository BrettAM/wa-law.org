<p>This act shall be known and cited as the interstate nurse licensure compact of 2021.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1645">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1645">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<p>a. The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;</p>
<p>b. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;</p>
<p>c. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</p>
<p>d. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;</p>
<p>e. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and</p>
<p>f. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general purposes of this compact are to:</p>
<p>a. Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;</p>
<p>b. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</p>
<p>c. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;</p>
<p>d. Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;</p>
<p>e. Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;</p>
<p>f. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and</p>
<p>g. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.</p>

<li>
<p>A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located.

</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state.

<li>
<p>Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.</p>

<p>In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:</p>
<p>a. Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.</p>
<pre><code> i. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state.

 ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action;
</code></pre>
<p>b. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state;</p>
<p>c. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations.

<p>d. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;</p>
<p>e. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions;</p>
<p>f. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse;</p>
<p>g. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.</p>

<li>
<p>Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the interstate commission, and at least 60 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the interstate commission shall file a notice of proposed rule making:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p>
<p>a. If the interstate commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</p>
<pre><code> i. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the interstate commission; and

 ii. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
</code></pre>
<p>b. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</p>
<p>c. Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states.</p>
<p>d. A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>e. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
<p>f. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

<p>c. In the event the interstate commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:</p>
<pre><code> i. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.

 ii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.

By majority vote, the interstate commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the interstate commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>c. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>
