[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5147-S2.xml)
## Section 1
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique set of challenges and circumstances that have tested the K-12 education system. Due to reduced instructional time, educational inequities, and the inability to access technology and educational services, many students have suffered learning loss and a disruption to their educational experience. As a result, the legislature finds that additional academic programs may help students to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to prevent negative educational outcomes. By utilizing a series of optional programs, including additional instructional days, opening various school facilities, extra academic opportunities, and an alternative school calendar, selected school districts will be better able to address the negative outcomes of the pandemic in a flexible and locally responsive manner while reengaging students to meet their social, physical, and academic needs.

## Section 2
(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, school districts that provide additional instructional days beyond the minimum number required under RCW 28A.150.220 during the 2021-22 school year may receive additional funding to assist in providing these instructional days.

## Section 7
The legislature recognizes that additional resources from the federal government may be forthcoming that could be used to fund the activities and purposes of this act.

If the office submits a request to the governor pursuant to RCW 43.79.270 for an allotment revision to spend unanticipated revenue that could be used for the purposes of this act, the request must contain a proposal to use the unanticipated moneys for the sole purpose of reducing allotments of appropriations made to implement this act and to place such moneys in unallotted reserve status.
