## Section 1
The legislature intends to define and authorize a collaborative school-based governance model for voluntary use by schools. The model is intended to: Increase the involvement of all staff and parents in the school-based team that develops the design of a school to meet the unique needs of the students, families, and school staff; advance school and student success; and improve the school's climate. This model is similar to the more than 120 teacher-powered public schools spanning at least 19 states, serving students from preschool to age 21, in urban, suburban, and rural settings.
