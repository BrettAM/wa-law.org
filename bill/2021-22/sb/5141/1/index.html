<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this act is to implement recommendations of the environmental justice task force created by section 221(48), chapter 415, Laws of 2019, entitled &quot;Report to the Washington state governor and legislature, Environmental Justice Task Force: Recommendations for Prioritizing EJ in Washington State Government (October 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government must concentrate on communities that currently do not meet environmental health standards.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>When considering the adoption of a significant agency action, an agency must conduct an environmental justice analysis as described in this section to better inform the agency in making its decision and to assist the agency with the equitable distribution of environmental investments, reduction of environmental harms, and the identification and reduction of racial and economic disparities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting an environmental justice analysis, an agency must:</p>
<p>a. Utilize cumulative impact analysis, such as the environmental health disparities map, in conjunction with other qualitative assessments and evaluation of other factors, including both environmental and socioeconomic stressors that may cumulatively affect health and the environment and contribute to persistent environmental health disparities;</p>
<p>b. Identify overburdened communities and vulnerable populations that may be affected by the proposed action and the cumulative positive and negative impacts and how those impacts may be distributed across communities;</p>
<p>c. Identify any local and regional impacts to tribal treaty reserved rights and resources;</p>
<p>d. Summarize community input and describe how overburdened communities and affected tribes may be further involved in development of the proposed action; and</p>
<p>e. Describe options for the agency to reduce the disproportionate impact on overburdened communities, or a reasonable justification for not doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To obtain information for purposes of this section, an agency may survey a representative sample of members from the overburdened community and should, whenever possible, consult with representatives of overburdened communities to assist in the accurate assessment of the impact of the action and in developing the means to reduce or eliminate the impact on overburdened communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the environmental justice analysis, the agency must reduce or eliminate the impacts imposed by the action on overburdened communities' vulnerable populations. The agency must consider, without limitation, each of the following methods for reducing such an impact:</p>
<p>a. Eliminating disparities and the unequal effect of environmental harms on overburdened communities;</p>
<p>b. Reducing or ensuring the action does not add to the cumulative impact on overburdened communities;</p>
<p>c. Providing equitable participation and meaningful engagement of overburdened communities in the development of the agency action;</p>
<p>d. Prioritizing equitable distribution of resources and benefits to overburdened communities;</p>
<p>e. Ensuring positive workforce and job outcomes for overburdened communities;</p>
<p>f. Meeting a community need identified by an overburdened community;</p>
<p>g. Modifying substantive regulatory or policy requirements; and</p>
<p>h. Any other mitigation techniques, including those suggested by the council, the office of equity, or representatives of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agency determines it cannot reduce the impact of the action on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, the agency must provide a clear explanation of why it has made that determination, make that explanation part of the record of the decision, and provide notice of that explanation to members of the public who participated in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agency may develop rules for criteria and procedures applicable to environmental justice analyses and its decisions based on those analyses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-14-239">Section 14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14-239">¶</a></h2>
<p>An agency must adopt a community engagement plan to evaluate new and existing services and programs for equitable participation and to support meaningful and direct involvement of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities. The plan must include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Best practices for outreach and communication to overcome barriers to engagement that are typical of agency work and address and mitigate barriers to engagement from vulnerable populations, overburdened communities, and others historically or currently marginalized groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of screening tools that integrate spatial, demographic, and health disparities data to evaluate and understand the nature and needs of the people who may be impacted by agency decisions, such as the environmental health disparities map, as well as further research with community members and organizations as needed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processes to include members of the affected communities including, but not limited to, child care and other expenses; and</p>

<li>
<p>Methods for outreach and communication with those who face barriers, language or otherwise, to participation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The plan must include:</p>
<p>a. Agency-specific goals and deliverables to reduce environmental health disparities and for otherwise achieving environmental justice in the agency's programs;</p>
<p>b. Metrics to track and measure accomplishments of the agency goals and deliverables;</p>
<p>c. Methods to equitably solicit and receive information and opinions from members of the public across Washington state;</p>

<li>
<p>In making such decisions relating to budget development, making investments, granting or withholding benefits, and distributing funding, an agency must:</p>
<p>a. Direct benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities to reduce statewide disparities;</p>
<p>b. Make investments proportional to the health disparities that a specific community experiences to eliminate the disparities;</p>
<p>c. Focus investments on creating environmental benefits, including eliminating health burdens, creating community and population resilience, and raising the quality of life of those in the community;</p>
<p>d. Ensure that investment priorities are self-determined by overburdened communities and vulnerable populations in the affected community through equitable participation;</p>
<p>e. Ensure geographic, racial, and ethnic equity by balancing investments across the state and within counties, local jurisdictions, and unincorporated areas as appropriate to reduce disparities by location and to ensure efforts contribute to a reduction in disparities that exist based on race and ethnicity;</p>
<p>f. Promote transparency by clearly articulating goals and assessment metrics to communicate where, why, and how funds are to be distributed;</p>
<p>g. Consider a broad scope of grants so that funds may be applied to a variety of purposes, including grants, hiring, and contracting opportunities, including:</p>
<pre><code> i. Community grants to monitor pollution and grants focused on building capacity and training for community scientists and other staff;

 ii. Technical assistance for communities that may be new to receiving agency grant funding; and

 iii. Education and work-readiness youth programs focused on infrastructure or utility-related internships to develop career paths for youth and, eventually, community leaders; and
