<h2 id="section-1-1414">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1414">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the antiswarming act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1049">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1049">¶</a></h2>
<p>Concerning creating the crime of swarming, the legislature finds that in recent years an increasingly common occurrence during public protests or demonstrations has been for crowds of protesters to block or otherwise obstruct or impede the flow of vehicular traffic on public streets and highways. Such obstruction also occurs in parking lots or other private properties, in which crowds of demonstrators will surround an automobile to hamper or prevent its movement. These obstructions are often accompanied by threats to drivers seeking passage through the protest area, and sometimes by physical attacks on automobiles or even on their drivers and passengers. The legislature finds such blockages, especially when accompanied by threats or physical attacks, can be traumatic and frightening to drivers and passengers in the targeted vehicles. Swarming actions can also be dangerous to the protesters involved, as drivers attempt to escape from the protest and in the process may cause bodily injury or even death to the protesters. In the interest of public safety, including the safety of both protesters and drivers, the legislature intends to prevent such actions and prohibit protesters from unlawfully blocking vehicular passage on public roadways or in commercial parking lots and to provide for criminal and civil penalties for violating this act.</p>
