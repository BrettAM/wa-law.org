<p>(1) The purpose of this act is to implement the recommendations of the pollinator health task force created by section 3, chapter 353, Laws of 2019, entitled &quot;Recommendations of the Pollinator Health Task Force - for Pollinator Health in Washington&quot; (November 2020).
(2) The task force provided recommendations to help prioritize and enact policy changes for pollinators in Washington. The recommendations are organized under five broad categories: (a) Habitat; (b) pesticides; (c) education; (d) managed pollinators; and (e) research.
(3) The task force met for the first time the same week that the Asian giant hornet was first discovered in Washington and the week after the Houdini fly was also reported for the first time in Washington. Asian giant hornets primarily hunt honey bees and destroy entire honey bee hives. The Houdini fly threatens native mason bee populations as well as managed mason bees. Washington is home to over 400 different species of native bees, 65 species of butterflies, as well as moths, wasps, beetles, flies, and hummingbirds. The loss of pollinators, managed and unmanaged, can lead to decreased yields of many fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Washington is currently the top producer in the United States of apples, sweet cherries, alfalfa, blueberries, and pears. In Washington state, honey bees and other pollinators are responsible for the production of tree fruits, small fruits, and other crops.
(4) The legislature intends by this act to implement various recommendations from the pollinator health task force to protect and expand the habitat upon which pollinators depend, by providing technical and financial assistance to public and private landowners, and by coordinating with state agencies and local governments in promoting practices to ensure sustainable, healthy populations of managed and native pollinators.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish a program to promote and protect pollinator habitat and the health and sustainability of pollinator species. As funds are made available, the program must provide technical and financial assistance to state agencies, local governments, and private landowners to implement practices that promote habitat for managed pollinators, as well as beekeeper and grower best management practices. The program must be administered in coordination with the apiary program established in chapter 15.60 RCW, the honey bee commission authorized in chapter 15.62 RCW, and programs administered by the conservation commission and conservation districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the department must:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>Evaluate and develop protocols that would increase communication between beekeepers, farmers and growers, and pesticide applicators including, but not limited to, education and outreach to beekeepers, farmers and growers, and pesticide applicators;</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>Review, in consultation with Washington State University, education needs related to pollinator education and develop a plan that outlines the goals related to pollinator education and the necessary partners, personnel, and other resources;</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>Create a catalog of current resources on best management practices and other educational resources related to pollinator health and make those resources available to the public on the department's website;</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>Document, in consultation with Washington State University, the bee species within the state and map their distributions as practicable;</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>Provide economic and environmental impacts of weed listing and categorization on pollinator health to county noxious weed control boards in consultation with the state noxious weed control board and annually submit a report to the noxious weed control board describing pollinator health issues;</strong></p>
<p>f. <strong>Provide materials, where practicable and in consultation with Washington State University, about certification programs that support pollinator health, biodiversity, and low-impact pesticide application to the public;</strong></p>
<p>g. <strong>Educate the public through plant nurseries about the necessity for blooming nectar plants to be available to pollinators throughout their respective active seasons;</strong></p>
<p>h. <strong>Survey registered beekeepers to determine whether the current apiary program should be expanded to include apiary inspections or registration of apiary yards;</strong></p>
<p>i. <strong>Continue and maintain partnership with federal agencies and neighboring states to promote and enhance the implementation of the national strategy to promote the health of honey bees and improve pollinator health;</strong></p>
<p>j. <strong>Increase the availability of pollinator-related resources on the department's website, as practicable, and other state agencies' websites as appropriate;</strong></p>
<p>k. <strong>Develop guidelines for allowing beekeeping on state managed lands so that impacts to wild pollinators from honey bees may be minimized; and</strong></p>
<p>l. <strong>In consultation with the department of revenue, review the open space taxation act and provide recommendations to the legislature, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, on options to include pollinator habitat in the current open space property tax classification.</strong></p>
