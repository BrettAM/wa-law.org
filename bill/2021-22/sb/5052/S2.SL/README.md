## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that people of color, Indian, people experiencing poverty, and immigrant populations experience significant health disparities compared to the general population, including more limited access to health care and poorer health outcomes. The legislature finds that these circumstances result in higher rates of morbidity and mortality for persons of color and immigrant populations than observed in the general population.
(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to create health equity zones to address significant health disparities identified by health outcome data. The state intends to work with community leaders within the health equity zones to share information and coordinate efforts with the goal of addressing the most urgent needs. Health equity zone partners shall develop, expand, and maintain positive relationships with communities of color, Indian communities, communities experiencing poverty, and immigrant communities within the zone to develop effective and sustainable programs to address health inequity.
