## Section 1
Amid unprecedented and ongoing stresses on our unemployment compensation fund and a sharp increase in the need for benefits during the COVID-19 public health emergency, the legislature intends to minimize the impact of public health precautionary measures on certain employers and the resulting impact on the experience rate component of their unemployment insurance premium rate. The first bill passed by the 2021 legislature and signed by the governor, ESSB 5061, provided immediate relief to all employers by noncharging $1.2 billion in benefits paid during the 11 weeks of the initial COVID-19 closures, reducing the social tax component for five years, and suspending the solvency surcharge until 2025. This swift action led to the state's average unemployment insurance tax rate in 2021 increasing by only 0.03 percent, instead of 0.85 percent as was expected if the legislature had not acted. The legislature now intends to prepare for 2022 by preemptively minimizing the disproportionate impact COVID-19 economic closures have had on certain businesses, while continuing to ensure a healthy unemployment compensation fund that can maintain critical economic support to Washington workers.

## Section 5
If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state or the eligibility of employers in this state for federal unemployment tax credits, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict, and the finding or determination does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state or the granting of federal unemployment tax credits to employers in this state.
