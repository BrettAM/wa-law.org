[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5309.xml)
## Section 1
(1) This section is the tax preference performance statement for the sales and use tax exemptions for diapers established in sections 2 and 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (sections 2 and 3 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.
(2) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief for certain individuals as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).
(3) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to authorize permanent sales and use tax exemptions for the purchase of diapers in order to lessen the tax burden on Washington families.
(4) Because the legislature intends for these tax preferences to be permanent, the joint legislative audit and review committee is not required to perform a tax preference review; however, these tax preferences must be included in the tax exemption report required under RCW 43.06.400 published by the department of revenue.

## Section 4
The provisions of RCW 82.32.805 and 82.32.808 do not apply to this act.
