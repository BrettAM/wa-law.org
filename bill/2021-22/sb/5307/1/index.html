Voluntary support services may include pretrial services programs, housing support programs, pretrial release programs provided in RCW 10.21.015, and other available state or community programs for which an arrested individual qualifies.

<p>(1) Subject to sections 308 and 403 of this act, the court may not impose a restrictive condition under section 306 of this act that requires initial payment of a fee in a sum greater than the arrested individual is able to pay from personal financial resources within 24 hours after the condition is imposed.

(3) Subject to sections 308 and 403 of this act, the court may not impose a secured appearance bond as a restrictive condition under section 306 of this act unless the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the arrested individual is likely to abscond, not appear, obstruct justice, or violate an order of protection.
(4) Subject to sections 308 and 403 of this act, the court may not impose a secured appearance bond as a restrictive condition under section 306 of this act:
(a) To keep an arrested individual detained;
(b) For a charge that is not a felony, unless the individual (i) has absconded; or (ii) did not appear in a criminal case or combination of criminal cases three or more times; or

<h2 id="section-308-25">Section 308 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-308-25">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) At the conclusion of a release hearing, the court may issue an order to detain the arrested individual temporarily until a detention hearing, or may impose a financial condition of release in an amount greater than the individual is able to pay from personal financial resources within 24 hours after the condition is imposed, only if the individual is charged with a covered offense and the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that:
(a) It is likely that the individual will abscond, obstruct justice, violate an order of protection, or there is substantial risk the arrested individual will commit a violent crime and that no less restrictive condition is sufficient to satisfactorily address the relevant risk the court identifies under section 303 of this act;
(b) The individual has violated a condition of an order of pretrial release for a pending criminal charge; or
(c) In a case in which the individual is charged with a felony, it is likely the individual will not appear, and no less restrictive condition is sufficient to satisfactorily address the relevant risk the court identifies under section 303 of this act.
(2) If under subsection (1) of this section the court issues an order to detain the arrested individual temporarily or imposes a financial condition of release in an amount greater than the individual is able to pay from personal financial resources within 24 hours after the condition is imposed, the court shall state its reasons in a record, including why no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions is sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="section-401-38">Section 401 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-401-38">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) If the court issues an order of temporary pretrial detention of an arrested individual under section 308 of this act, or pretrial release of an arrested individual under section 304 of this act subject to a restrictive condition that results in continued detention of the individual, the court shall hold a hearing to consider continued detention of the individual pending trial. The hearing must be held within three days not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday after issuance of the order.
(2) The court on its own or on motion of the prosecuting attorney may continue a detention hearing for good cause for no more than three days not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(3) The court shall continue a detention hearing on motion of the detained individual.
(4) At the conclusion of a detention hearing, the court shall issue an order of pretrial release or detention.</p>
<h2 id="section-402-37">Section 402 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-402-37">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) At a detention hearing, the detained individual has a right to counsel. If the individual is indigent, a public defense services agency or provider shall provide counsel.

<h2 id="section-403-27">Section 403 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-403-27">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) At a detention hearing, the court shall consider the criteria in sections 303 through 307 of this act to determine whether to issue an order of pretrial detention or continue, amend, or eliminate a restrictive condition that has resulted in continued detention of the detained individual. If failure to satisfy a secured appearance bond or pay a fee is the only reason the individual continues to be detained, the fact of detention is prima facie evidence that the individual is unable to satisfy the bond or pay the fee.
(2) The court at a detention hearing may issue an order of pretrial detention or continue a restrictive condition of release that results in detention only if the detained individual is charged with a covered offense and the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that:
(a) It is likely that the individual will abscond, obstruct justice, violate an order of protection, or there is substantial risk the arrested individual will commit a violent crime and no less restrictive condition is sufficient to satisfactorily address the relevant risk the court identifies under section 303 of this act; or
(b) In a case where the individual is charged with a felony, it is likely that the individual will not appear, and no less restrictive condition is sufficient to satisfactorily address the relevant risk the court identifies under section 303 of this act.
(3) If under subsection (2) of this section the court issues an order of pretrial detention or continues a restrictive condition of release that results in detention, the court shall state its reasons in a record, including why no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions is sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="section-501-29">Section 501 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-501-29">¶</a></h2>

(2) Vacate an order of pretrial detention and issue an order of pretrial release; or
(3) Issue an order of pretrial detention.</p>
<h2 id="section-502-24">Section 502 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-502-24">¶</a></h2>
<p>On its own or on motion of a party, the court may modify an order of pretrial release or detention using the procedures and standards in Articles 3 and 4 of this chapter. The court may consider new information relevant to the order, including information that the individual subject to the order has violated a condition of release. The court may deny the motion summarily if it is not supported by new information.</p>
<h2 id="section-601-26">Section 601 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-601-26">¶</a></h2>
<p>In applying and construing this chapter, consideration must be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> court <strong>that</strong> releases a defendant arrested or charged with a violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 on the offender's personal recognizance or personal recognizance with conditions must state <strong>its reasons in a</strong> record <strong>including why no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions is sufficient, consistent with section 308(2) of this act</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The judicial officer must hold a hearing in cases involving offenses prescribed in Article I, section 20, to determine whether any condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community upon motion of the attorney for the government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing must be held immediately upon the defendant's first appearance before the judicial officer unless the defendant, or the attorney for the government, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of such person may not exceed <strong>three</strong> days (not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday), and a continuance on motion of the attorney for the government may not exceed three days (not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday). During a continuance, such person must be detained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the hearing, such defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain representation, to have counsel appointed. The defendant must be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. The facts the judicial officer uses to support a finding that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community must be supported by clear and convincing evidence of a propensity for violence that creates a substantial likelihood of danger to the community or any persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant may be detained pending completion of the hearing. The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the judicial officer, at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community.</p>
