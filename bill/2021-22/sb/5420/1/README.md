## Section 1
The legislature finds that state data reporting requirements for hospitals are placing unwarranted burdens on the health care system during the national and state emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the legislature finds that a moratorium on state agencies imposing new data and information reporting obligations on hospitals, other than reporting necessary for COVID-19 pandemic patient care and vaccinations, is necessary to allow an assessment of current hospital reporting obligations. The legislature further finds that such an assessment must identify which hospital data reporting obligations need to be modified and whether collecting additional data or information fulfills legislative objectives.
