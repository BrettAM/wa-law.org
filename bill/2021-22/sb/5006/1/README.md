## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state will continue to see significant population growth, with office of financial management forecasts estimating nearly 2,000,000 more people by the year 2040. In the face of this dramatic growth, the legislature finds that it is more important than ever to help preserve, maintain, and enhance local parks, trails, and open spaces that are key contributors to the state's quality of life. 
The legislature further finds that local parks and recreation agencies confronted with this growth are suffering severe budget impacts brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the utilization of parks, open spaces, and trails has spiked up dramatically. A just-completed comprehensive survey of local parks and recreation agencies has found that they have had to reduce expenditures by nearly 25 percent on average and have experienced a 61 percent loss of earned revenue, even though more than two-thirds of those agencies are seeing major upticks in the utilization of their parks and trails, and one agency saw a 170 percent increase in usage.
Finally, the legislature finds that local parks and recreation agencies are dealing with a tremendous growth in the number of sports participants and a corollary of sharp increases in demand for local athletic fields, including a nearly 300 percent increase in adult sports participation being experienced by one eastern Washington community.
Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish additional statutory tools to help local parks and recreation agencies better address maintenance backlogs, preserve quality open spaces, and expand and improve athletic fields to accommodate the influx of adult and youth sports participants who are vying for use of those fields.
