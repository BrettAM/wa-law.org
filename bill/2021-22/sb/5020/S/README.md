# Substitute Senate Bill 5020 as Recommended by Health & Long Term Care

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5020-S.xml)
## Section 1
(1) The legislature recognizes a need to protect the safety, health, and economic well-being of Washington residents by guarding them from the negative and harmful impact of unsupported price increases for prescription drugs.
(2) The legislature finds that:
(a) Access to prescription drugs is necessary for people to maintain or acquire good health;
(b) Unsupported price increases negatively impact the ability of people to obtain prescription drugs and thereby endanger the health and safety of such people by making it difficult for them to maintain or acquire good health;
(c) Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs threaten the economic well-being of Washington residents and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary and essential goods and services, including housing, food, and utilities;
(d) Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs contribute significantly to a dramatic and unsustainable rise in health care costs and health insurance, which threatens the overall ability of people to obtain health coverage and maintain or acquire good health; and
(e) Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs contribute significantly to rising state costs for health care provided and paid for through state-funded medical assistance programs for Washington residents who are older, are living with disabilities, or have low incomes; and health insurance programs for public employees, including employees of the state, municipalities and counties, school districts, institutions of higher education, and retirees whose health care costs are funded by public programs, thereby threatening the ability of the state to fund those programs adequately and further threatening the ability of the state to fund other programs necessary for the public good and safety, such as public education and public safety.
(3) Analysis of the increase in prices charged by manufacturers of prescription drugs demonstrates that many price increases for high-cost and high-volume prescription drugs are not supported by adequate evidence of improved clinical benefit or by significant increase in costs to the manufacturer related to the production or sale of the product.
(4) Based on the findings contained in this section, the legislature intends to pass this act as an essential means to protect the health and well-being of Washington residents from the negative impacts of unsupported price increases.

## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [43.71C.010](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.071C_prescription_drug_costs.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.071C_prescription_drug_costs.md) for context.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Authority" means the health care authority.

2. "Covered drug" means any prescription drug that:

    a. A covered manufacturer intends to introduce to the market at a wholesale acquisition cost of ten thousand dollars or more for a course of treatment lasting less than one month or a thirty-day supply, whichever period is longer; or

    b. Is currently on the market, is manufactured by a covered manufacturer, and has a wholesale acquisition cost of more than one hundred dollars for a course of treatment lasting less than one month or a thirty-day supply, and, taking into account only price increases that take effect after July 28, 2019, the manufacturer increases the wholesale acquisition cost at least:

        i. Twenty percent, including the proposed increase and the cumulative increase over one calendar year prior to the date of the proposed increase; or

        ii. Fifty percent, including the proposed increase and the cumulative increase over three calendar years prior to the date of the proposed increase.

3. "Covered manufacturer" means a person, corporation, or other entity engaged in the manufacture of prescription drugs sold in or into Washington state. "Covered manufacturer" does not include a private label distributor or retail pharmacy that sells a drug under the retail pharmacy's store, or a prescription drug repackager.

4. **"Department" means the department of revenue.**

5. "Health care provider," "health plan," "health carrier," and "carrier" mean the same as in RCW 48.43.005.

6. **"Identified drug" means any legend drug that is newly identified to have an unsupported price increase in the unsupported price increase report published on or after October 1, 2021.**

7. **"Legend drug" has the same meaning as in RCW 69.41.010.**

8. "Pharmacy benefit manager" means the same as in RCW 19.340.010.

9. "Pharmacy services administrative organization" means an entity that contracts with a pharmacy to act as the pharmacy's agent with respect to matters involving a pharmacy benefit manager, third-party payor, or other entities, including negotiating, executing, or administering contracts with the pharmacy benefit manager, third-party payor, or other entities and provides administrative services to pharmacies.

10. "Prescription drug" means a drug regulated under chapter 69.41 or 69.50 RCW, including generic, brand name, specialty drugs, and biological products that are prescribed for outpatient use and distributed in a retail setting.

11. "Qualifying price increase" means a price increase described in subsection (2)(b) of this section.

12. **"Sales" means legend drug sales into the state directly by the manufacturer, or indirectly through a private label distributor, wholesaler, or other distributor as defined in RCW 69.41.010.**

13. **"Unsupported price increase" means an increase in price for a legend drug for which there was no, or inadequate, new clinical evidence to support the price increase. In order to determine whether a price increase for a legend drug is unsupported by new clinical evidence, the state must utilize the analyses of legend drugs in the unsupported price increase report.**

14. **"Unsupported price increase report" means the analyses of legend drugs prepared annually by the institute for clinical and economic review and published in its annual unsupported price increase report or similar analysis created by another third party. "Unsupported price increase report" does not include reports that use analyses that use the cost-per-quality adjusted life year or similar measure to identify subpopulations for which a treatment would be less cost-effective due to severity of illness, age, or preexisting disability.**

15. "Wholesale acquisition cost" or "price" means, with respect to a prescription **or legend** drug, the manufacturer's list price for the drug to wholesalers or direct purchasers in the United States, excluding any discounts, rebates, or reductions in price, for the most recent month for which the information is available, as reported in wholesale price guides or other publications of prescription **or legend** drug pricing.


## Section 6
If the reliance on an unsupported price increase report to identify drugs subject to the penalties prescribed in this act is found to be invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is terminated.
