# Senate Bill 5149

## Section 1
The legislature finds that:
(1) A strong public health system improves the health and well-being of all state residents. Prevention of chronic diseases and illness and health promotion activities benefit all state residents and communities, including residents receiving medicaid.
(2) COVID-19 has dramatically exposed the vulnerabilities and limitations of the public health system. The shortcomings of the system are front and center during the pandemic response. Additionally, the lack of a national pandemic strategy has significantly burdened state and local health departments and further strained the system. As the worst of COVID-19 comes to an end in the coming year, there is a need to address the chronically underfunded public health system.
(3) Health status is impacted both by social determinants of health and untreated or inadequately treated health conditions. Consequently, it is vital that public and private sectors work to enhance public health capabilities and capacity.
(4) Medicaid treats patients who generally have poorer health outcomes than the overall population, and adults with medicaid coverage are more likely to have chronic conditions. Therefore, public health investments will benefit medicaid enrollees with improving their overall health and well-being. Additionally, there are over 800,000 children enrolled in medicaid who benefit from the strong vaccination programs that public health provides.
(5) With any state funding of foundational public health services, the state expects that measurable benefits will be realized to the health of communities in Washington as a result of the improved capacity of the governmental public health system.
