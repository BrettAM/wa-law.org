## Section 1
The legislature finds that requiring additional paperwork for projects that meet the prima facie requirements of the categorical exemptions in chapter 43.21C RCW is unnecessary and adds costs to important projects, such as housing. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide relief from superfluous paperwork for applicants whose actions are categorically exempt from the requirements of chapter 43.21C RCW.
