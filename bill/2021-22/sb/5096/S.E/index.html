<p>(1) The legislature recognizes that a tax system that is fair, balanced, and works for everyone is essential to help all Washingtonians grow and thrive. But Washington's tax system today is the most regressive in the nation because it asks those making the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Middle-income families in Washington pay two to four times more in taxes, as a percentage of household income, as compared to top earners in the state. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least six times more than do our wealthiest residents. To begin to rebalance the tax code, the legislature intends to enact an excise tax on the sale of certain capital assets.
(2) The excise tax on capital gains is a tax on the one-time, voluntary sale or exchange of a capital asset, not a tax on ownership of the asset itself. This excise tax is paid only by those individuals who engage in voluntary sales or exchanges of Washington capital assets, either directly or indirectly through their ownership interest in an entity that engages in voluntary sales or exchanges of Washington capital assets, and is measured by the realization of significant net gain on the aggregate of such transactions during the taxable year. In order to protect against further regressive impacts of the tax system, encourage the everyday investments that Washingtonians of all income levels strive for, and support our economy, this excise tax will not apply to capital gains realized by certain sales and transfers.
(3) To help meet the state's obligations to its people, the legislature dedicates the first $350,000,000 in revenue collected from this excise tax to the state's education legacy trust account. This funding is critically needed to provide support for education, especially early learning and child care, and to provide for the economic security of low-income households who are struggling to afford quality child care and preschool. Furthermore, the legislature finds that increasing taxes on the wealthiest residents is only one-half of the effort to rebalance the tax code. In an effort to both reduce the tax burden on those earning the least and to account for anticipated volatility in revenue collections from the capital gains excise tax, revenue received above base levels will be deposited into the taxpayer fairness account. Revenues deposited in this account will be used to offset existing tax burdens via policies such as funding of the working families' tax exemption.</p>

<p>(1) Beginning January 1, 2022, an excise tax is imposed on the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets. Only individuals are subject to payment of the tax, which equals seven percent multiplied by an individual's Washington capital gains.
(2) If an individual's Washington capital gains are less than zero for a taxable year, no tax is due under this section and no such amount is allowed as a carryover for use in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, as defined in section 102(1) of this act, for any taxable year. To the extent that a loss carryforward is included in the calculation of an individual's federal net long-term capital gain and that loss carryforward is directly attributable to losses from sales or exchanges allocated to this state under section 108 of this act, the loss carryforward is included in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain for the purposes of this chapter. An individual may not include any losses carried back for federal income tax purposes in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain for any taxable year.
(3)(a) The tax imposed in this section applies to the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets owned by the taxpayer, whether the taxpayer was the legal or beneficial owner of such assets at the time of the sale or exchange. The tax applies when the Washington capital gains are recognized by the taxpayer in accordance with this chapter.
(b) For purposes of this chapter:
(i) An individual is considered to be a beneficial owner of long-term capital assets held by an entity that is a pass-through or disregarded entity for federal tax purposes, such as a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, or grantor trust, to the extent of the individual's ownership interest in the entity as reported for federal income tax purposes.

Sec. 2511 of the internal revenue code and its accompanying regulations. A grantor of such trust is considered the beneficial owner of the capital assets of the trust for purposes of the tax imposed in this section and must include any long-term capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset by the trust in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, if such gain or loss is allocated to this state under section 108 of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-104-30">Section 104 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-104-30">¶</a></h2>

(2) A controlling interest in an entity only to the extent that any long-term capital gain or loss from such sale or exchange is directly attributable to the entity's interest in real property and the sale or exchange was subject to tax under chapter 82.45 RCW. The department is not bound by the parties' agreement as to the allocation of consideration or fair market value, if such allocation or fair market value does not reflect the fair market value of the real property. For purposes of this subsection (2), &quot;controlling interest&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 82.45.033;

(5) Cattle, horses, or breeding livestock if for the taxable year of the sale or exchange, more than 50 percent of the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year, including from the sale or exchange of capital assets, is from farming or ranching;

(b)(i) Except as provided in (b)(ii) of this subsection (1), returns and all supporting documents must be filed electronically using the department's online tax filing service or other method of electronic reporting as the department may authorize.
(ii) The department may waive the electronic filing requirement in this subsection for good cause as provided in RCW 82.32.080.

(3) Each taxpayer required to file a return under this section must, without assessment, notice, or demand, pay any tax due thereon to the department on or before the date fixed for the filing of the return, regardless of any filing extension.
