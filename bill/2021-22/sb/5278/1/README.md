## Section 1
The purpose of this act is to:
(1) Protect construction employees and their families by ensuring that employment obligations of wage and benefit contribution payments are made for their work on privately funded construction projects;
(2) Protect construction employers who are put at a competitive disadvantage by others that fail to pay wages and benefit contributions;
(3) Encourage self-policing in the construction industry, where subcontractors fail to comply with employment obligations or where subcontracting is used to evade employment obligations, by making direct contractors liable for the wage and benefit contributions not paid by subcontractors; and
(4) Give direct contractors the means to monitor the wage and benefit contribution payments of subcontractors, as is similarly required on publicly funded construction projects.
