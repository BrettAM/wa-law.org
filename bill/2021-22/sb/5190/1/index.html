<p>a. A contribution paying base year employer, except employers as provided in subsection (5) of this section, not otherwise eligible for relief of charges for benefits under this section, may receive such relief if the benefit charges result from payment to an individual who:</p>

<p>An employer's experience rating account may not be relieved of charges for a benefit payment and an employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefit payments may not be credited for a benefit payment if a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to the claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure and the employer or employer's agent has a pattern of such failures. The commissioner has the authority to determine whether the employer has good cause under this subsection.</p>

<li>
<p>For health care employees who are covered under this title, there exists a prima facie presumption that any infectious or contagious diseases which are the subject of a public health emergency are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140 during a public health emergency. There is a presumption that the health care employee contracted or was exposed to the disease at the health care facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care employee must provide verification, as required by the department by rule, to the department and the self-insured employer that the employee has contracted or is in quarantine after exposure to the infectious or contagious disease that is the subject of the public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This presumption of occupational disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that:</p>
<p>a. The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or</p>
<p>b. The employee was working from the employee's home, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for a period of 14 or more consecutive days immediately prior to the employee's injury, occupational disease, or period of incapacity resulted from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of RCW 51.32.090(7), the period of 14 consecutive calendar days shall be 10 consecutive calendar days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<p>a. When a determination involving the presumption established under this section is appealed to the board of industrial insurance appeals and the final decision allows the claim of benefits, the board of industrial insurance appeals shall order that all reasonable costs of the appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party. If the opposing party is a state fund employer, the costs and fees are paid by the employer.</p>
<p>b. When a determination involving the presumption established in this section is appealed to any court and the final decision allows the claim for benefits, the court shall order that all reasonable costs of appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party.</p>
<p>c. When reasonable costs of the appeal must be paid by the department under this section in a state fund case, the costs shall be paid from the accident fund and charged to the costs of the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs of the payments under this section shall not affect the experience rating of employers insured by the state fund. These costs shall be paid from the accident fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section:</p>
<p>a. &quot;Health care employee&quot; means an employee who is directly involved in the delivery of health services in a health care facility.</p>
<p>b. &quot;Contracted&quot; means whichever date occurs first of the following:</p>
<pre><code> i. The date that the health care employee first missed work due to symptoms of the infectious or contagious disease;

 ii. The date the health care employee was quarantined by a medical provider or public health official; or

 iii. The date the health care employee received a positive test result confirming contraction of the infectious or contagious disease.
</code></pre>
<p>c. &quot;Health care facility&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 9A.50.010.</p>
<p>d. &quot;Public health emergency&quot; means a declaration or order that covers the jurisdiction where the unemployed individual was working on the date the individual became unemployed concerning any dangerous, contagious, or infectious diseases, including a pandemic, and is issued as follows:</p>
<pre><code> i. The president of the United States has declared a national or regional emergency; or

 ii. The governor of Washington declared a state of emergency under RCW 43.06.010(12).
