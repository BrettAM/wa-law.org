# Senate Bill 5444

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5444.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state. At the same time, the legislature also finds that there is a need to ensure that the greater adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles does not reduce funds to maintain and improve transportation infrastructure and that there is a need for fairness in how these funds are generated. The legislature also finds that a road usage charge or per mile fee system appears to be a viable method to ensure these goals are achieved. It is therefore the legislature's intent to impose a per mile fee to mitigate the impact of increased electric and hybrid vehicles on state roads and highways and to allow further evaluation of the feasibility of transitioning from a revenue collection system based on fuel taxes to a per mile funding system.
The legislature further finds and declares that the per mile funding system must at all times recognize and respect an individual's interests in privacy, information use, and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, as well as the research and year-long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a way that ensures data security and protects the privacy of vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the per mile funding system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data. Detailed travel locations or patterns must not be disclosed, and legal and technical safeguards must protect personal information.

## Section 3

1. Before accepting an application for an annual vehicle registration renewal for a vehicle that both (a) uses at least one method of propulsion that is capable of being reenergized by an external source of electricity and (b) is capable of traveling at least thirty miles using only battery power, the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director must require the applicant to pay a one hundred dollar fee in addition to any other fees and taxes required by law. The one hundred dollar fee is due only at the time of annual registration renewal.

2. This section only applies to a vehicle that is designed to have the capability to drive at a speed of more than thirty-five miles per hour.

3. [Empty]

    a. The fee under this section is imposed to provide funds to mitigate the impact of vehicles on state roads and highways and for the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of transitioning from a revenue collection system based on fuel taxes to a road user assessment system, and is separate and distinct from other vehicle license fees. Proceeds from the fee must be used for highway purposes, and must be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070, subject to (b) of this subsection.

    b. If in any year the amount of proceeds from the fee collected under this section exceeds one million dollars, the excess amount over one million dollars must be deposited as follows:

        i. Seventy percent to the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070;

        ii. Fifteen percent to the transportation improvement account created in RCW 47.26.084; and

        iii. Fifteen percent to the rural arterial trust account created in RCW 36.79.020.

4. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the fee established in subsection (1) of this section, before accepting an application for an annual vehicle registration renewal for a vehicle that both (i) uses at least one method of propulsion that is capable of being reenergized by an external source of electricity and (ii) is capable of traveling at least thirty miles using only battery power, the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director must require the applicant to pay a fifty dollar fee.

    b. The fee required under (a) of this subsection must be distributed as follows:

        i. The first one million dollars raised by the fee must be deposited into the multimodal transportation account created in RCW 47.66.070; and

        ii. Any remaining amounts must be deposited into the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070.

5. This section applies to annual vehicle registration renewals until the effective date of enacted legislation that imposes a vehicle miles traveled fee or tax. **However, for purposes of this subsection, the establishment of the voluntary early adoption program described in section 2(3) of this act does not constitute legislation that imposes a vehicle miles traveled fee or tax.**

6. **Beginning July 1, 2025, participants in the voluntary early adoption program described in section 2(3) of this act are exempt from the fees specified in this section.**


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [46.17.324](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md) for context.

To realize the environmental benefits of electrification of the transportation system it is necessary to support the adoption of electric vehicles and other electric technology in the state by incentivizing the purchase of these vehicles, building out the charging infrastructure, developing greener transit options, and supporting clean alternative fuel infrastructure. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support these activities through the imposition of new transportation electrification fees in this section.

1. **Until July 1, 2026, a** vehicle that both (a) uses at least one method of propulsion that is capable of being reenergized by an external source of electricity and (b) is capable of traveling at least thirty miles using only battery power, is subject to an annual seventy-five dollar transportation electrification fee to be collected by the department, county auditor, or other agent or subagent appointed by the director, in addition to any other fees and taxes required by law. For administrative efficiencies, the transportation electrification fee must be collected at the same time as vehicle registration renewals and may only be collected for vehicles that are renewing an annual vehicle registration.

2. Beginning October 1, 2019, **and until July 1, 2026,** in lieu of the fee in subsection (1) of this section for a hybrid or alternative fuel vehicle that is not required to pay the fees established in RCW 46.17.323 (1) and (4), the department, county auditor, or other agent or subagent appointed by the director must require that the applicant for the annual vehicle registration renewal of such hybrid or alternative fuel vehicle pay a seventy-five dollar hybrid vehicle transportation electrification fee, in addition to any other fees and taxes required by law. **However, the fee imposed under this subsection does not apply to applicants participating in the voluntary early adoption program described in section 2(3) of this act.**

3. **Beginning July 1, 2026, the department, county auditor, or other agent or subagent appointed by the director must require that an applicant for the annual vehicle registration renewal for vehicles specified in this subsection to pay a $75 hybrid vehicle transportation electrification fee, in addition to any other fees and taxes required by law. This fee applies to:**

    a. **An electric or hybrid vehicle that uses at least one method of propulsion that is capable of being reenergized by an external source of electricity, but is not capable of traveling at least 30 miles using only battery power; or**

    b. **A hybrid electric and gasoline vehicle that is not a plug-in hybrid.**

4. The fees required under this section must be deposited in the electric vehicle account created in RCW 82.44.200, until July 1, 2025, when the fee must be deposited in the motor vehicle account.

5. This section only applies to a vehicle that is designed to have the capability to drive at a speed of more than thirty-five miles per hour.

6. **Beginning July 1, 2025, participants in the voluntary early adoption program described in section 2(3) of this act are exempt from the fees specified in subsection (1) of this section.**
