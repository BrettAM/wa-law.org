<h2 id="section-1-1153">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1153">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature acknowledges that school districts and charter schools are faced with challenging decisions regarding how to operate their schools during COVID-19 and whether they should offer in-person learning, distance learning, or hybrid or rotating schedules. The legislature recognizes that full-time, distance learning presents many challenges and hardships to students and families.
(2) The legislature finds that the best metric for determining prevalence of COVID-19 in a community is tied to the positivity standard within a county. This metric does not punish communities for testing more, as does a metric tied to cases per population. Further, the positivity metrics are linked to the world health organization metrics.
(3) The legislature intends to establish clear school opening metrics based on the positivity standard within counties, so these decisions are transparent and uniform throughout the state of Washington.</p>

<p>a. Any person being on the public streets, or in the public parks, or at any other public place during the hours declared by the governor to be a period of curfew;</p>
<p>b. Any number of persons, as designated by the governor, from assembling or gathering on the public streets, parks, or other open areas of this state, either public or private;</p>
<p>c. The manufacture, transfer, use, possession or transportation of a molotov cocktail or any other device, instrument or object designed to explode or produce uncontained combustion;</p>

<p>g. Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).</p>
</li>
<li>
